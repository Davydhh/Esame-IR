The initial scene of the Gospel in today’s liturgy (see Jn 6,24-35) shows us some boats moving towards Capernaum: the crowd is going to look for Jesus. We might think that this is a very good thing, yet the Gospel teaches us that it is not enough to seek God; we must also ask why we are seeking him. Indeed, Jesus says: “You seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves” (v. 26). The people, in fact, had witnessed the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves, but they had not grasped the meaning of that gesture: they stopped at the external miracle, they stopped at the material bread: there only, without going beyond, to the meaning of this. Here then is a first question we can ask ourselves: why do we seek the Lord? Why do I seek the Lord? What are the motivations  for my faith, for our faith? We need to discern this, because among the many temptations we encounter in life, among the many temptations there is one that we might call idolatrous temptation. It is the one that drives us to seek God for our own use, to solve problems, to have thanks to Him what we cannot obtain on our own, for our interests. But in this way faith remains superficial and even, if I may say so, faith remains miraculous: we look for God to feed us and then forget about Him when we are satiated. At the centre of this immature faith is not God, but our own needs. I think of our interests, many things … It is right to present our needs to God's heart, but the Lord, who acts far beyond our expectations, wishes to live with us first of all in a relationship of love. And true love is disinterested, it is free: one does not love to receive a favour in return! This is self-interest; and very often in life we are motivated by self-interest. A second question that the crowd asks Jesus can help us: “What must we do, to be doing the works of God?” (v. 28). It is as if the people, provoked by Jesus, were saying: “How can we purify our search for God? How do we go from a magical faith, which thinks only of our own needs, to a faith that pleases God?” And Jesus shows the way: He answers that the work of God is to welcome the One whom the Father has sent, that is, welcoming Himself, Jesus. It is not adding religious practices or observing special precepts; it is welcoming Jesus, it is welcoming Him into our lives, living a story of love with Jesus. It is He who will purify our faith. We are not able to do this on our own. But the Lord wants a loving relationship with us: before the things we receive and do, there is Him to love. There is a relationship with Him that goes beyond the logic of interest and calculation. This applies to God, but it also applies to our human and social relationships: when we seek first and foremost the satisfaction of our needs, we risk using people and exploiting situations for our own ends. How many times have we heard it said of someone; “But he uses people and then forgets about them”? Using people for one’s own gain: this is bad. And a society that puts interests instead of people at its centre is a society that does not generate life. The Gospel’s invitation is this: rather than being concerned only with the material bread that feeds us, let us welcome Jesus as the bread of life and, starting out from our friendship with Him, learn to love each other. Freely and without calculation. Love given freely and without calculation, without using people, freely, with generosity, with magnanimity. Let us now pray to the Holy Virgin, She who lived the most beautiful story of love with God, that she may give us the grace to open ourselves to the encounter with her Son.","pope":"Francis","type":"Angelus","year":2021}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610950e4ce5ca320689a93ef"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Good morning! Unfortunately we have had to return to holding this audience in the library, to protect ourselves against contagion by Covid. This also teaches us that we must be very attentive to the prescriptions of the authorities, both the political authorities and health authorities, in order to protect ourselves against this pandemic. Let us offer to the Lord this distance between us, for the good of all, and let us think, let us think a lot about the sick, about those who are already marginalized when they enter the hospitals; let us think about the doctors, the nurses, the volunteers, the many people who work with the sick at this time: they risk their life but they do so out of love for their neighbour, as a vocation. Let us pray for them. During his public life, Jesus constantly availed himself of the power of prayer. The Gospels show this to us when he retired to secluded places to pray. These are sober and discreet observations that allow us only to imagine those prayerful dialogues. They clearly demonstrate, however, that even at times of greater dedication to the poor and the sick, Jesus never neglected his intimate dialogue with the Father. The more he was immersed in the needs of the people, the more he felt the need to repose in the Trinitarian Communion, to return to the Father and the Spirit. In Jesus’ life there is therefore a secret, hidden from human eyes, which is the fulcrum of everything. Jesus’ prayer is a mysterious reality, of which we grasp only something, but which allows us to interpret his entire mission from the right perspective. In those solitary hours — before dawn or at night — Jesus immerses himself in his intimacy with the Father, that is, in the Love that every soul thirsts for. This is what emerges from the very first days of his public ministry. One Sabbath, for example, the town of Capernaum was transformed into a \"field hospital\": after sunset they brought all the sick to Jesus, and he healed them. Before dawn, however, Jesus disappeared: he withdrew to a solitary place and prayed. Simon and the others looked for him and when they found him they said: “Everyone is searching for you!” How does Jesus reply? “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out” (cf. Mk 1:35-38). Jesus always goes a bit further, further in prayer with the Father, and beyond, to other villages, other horizons, to go and preach, other peoples. Prayer is the rudder that guides Jesus’ course. The stages of his mission were not dictated by success, nor by consensus, or the seductive phrase “everyone is searching for you”. Jesus’ path was charted by the least comfortable one, which obeyed the Father’s inspiration, which Jesus heard and welcomed in his solitary prayer. The Catechism states that “when Jesus prays he is already teaching us how to pray” (no. 2607). Therefore, from Jesus’ example we can derive some characteristics of Christian prayer. First and foremost, it possesses primacy: it is the first desire of the day, something that is practised at dawn, before the world awakens. It restores a soul to what otherwise would be without breath. A day lived without prayer risks being transformed into a bothersome or tedious experience: everything that happens to us could turn into a badly endured and blind fate for us. Jesus instead teaches an obedience to reality and, therefore, to listening. Prayer is primarily listening and encountering God. The problems of everyday life, then, do not become obstacles, but appeals from God himself to listen to and encounter those who are in front of us. The trials of life thus change into opportunities to grow in faith and charity. The daily journey, including hardships, acquires the perspective of a “vocation”. Prayer has the power to transform into good what in life would otherwise be a sentence; prayer has the power to open the mind to a great horizon and to broaden the heart. Secondly, prayer is an art to be practised insistently. Jesus himself says to us: knock, knock, knock. We are all capable of sporadic prayers, which arise from a momentary emotion; but Jesus educates us in another type of prayer: the one that knows a discipline, an exercise, and is assumed within a rule of life. Consistent prayer produces progressive transformation, makes us strong in times of tribulation, gives us the grace to be supported by the One who loves us and always protects us. Another characteristic of Jesus’ prayer is solitude. Those who pray do not escape from the world, but prefer deserted places. There, in silence, many voices can emerge that we hide in our innermost selves: the most repressed desires, the truths that we insist on suffocating, and so on. And, above all, in silence God speaks. Every person needs a space for him or herself, somewhere to cultivate their interior life, where actions find meaning again. Without an interior life we become superficial, agitated, and anxious — how anxiety harms us! This is why we must turn to prayer; without an interior life we flee from reality, and we also flee from ourselves, we are men and women always on the run. Lastly, Jesus’ prayer is the place where we perceive that everything comes from God and returns to him. Sometimes we human beings believe that we are the masters of everything, or on the contrary, we lose all self-esteem, we go from one side to the other. Prayer helps us to find the right dimension in our relationship with God, our Father, and with all creation. And Jesus’ prayer, in the end, means delivering oneself into the hands of the Father, like Jesus in the olive grove, in that anguish: “Father, if it is possible … but may your will be done”. Delivering oneself into the hands of the Father. It is beautiful, when we are agitated, a bit worried, and the Holy Spirit transforms us from within and leads us to this surrendering into the hands of the Father: “Father, let your will be done”. Dear brothers and sisters, let us rediscover Jesus Christ as a teacher of prayer in the Gospel and place ourselves in his school. I assure you that we will find joy and peace.","pope":"Francis","type":"Audience","year":2020}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6109513fce5ca320689a93f0"},"text":"Your Holiness, dear Brother, With deep affection and spiritual closeness, I send you my cordial good wishes of grace and peace in the love of the Risen Lord. In these past weeks, I have often thought of writing to you to explain more fully the gift of some fragments of the relics of the Apostle Peter that I presented to Your Holiness through the distinguished delegation from the Ecumenical Patriarchate led by Archbishop Job of Telmessos which took part in the patronal feast of the Church of Rome. Your Holiness knows well that the uninterrupted tradition of the Roman Church has always testified that the Apostle Peter, after his martyrdom in the Circus of Nero, was buried in the adjoining necropolis of the Vatican Hill. His tomb quickly became a place of pilgrimage for the faithful from every part of the Christian world. Later, the Emperor Constantine erected the Vatican Basilica dedicated to Saint Peter over the site of the tomb of the Apostle. In June 1939, immediately following his election, my predecessor Pope Pius XII decided to undertake excavations beneath the Vatican Basilica. The works led first to the discovery of the exact burial place of the Apostle and later, in 1952, to the discovery, under the high altar of the Basilica, of a funerary niche attached to a red wall dated to the year 150 and covered with precious graffiti, including one of fundamental importance which reads, in Greek, Πετρος ευι. This contained bones that can quite reasonably be considered those of the Apostle Peter. From those relics, now enshrined in the necropolis under Saint Peter's Basilica, Pope Saint Paul VI had nine fragments removed for the private chapel of the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace. The nine fragments were placed in a bronze case bearing the inscription, Ex ossibus quae in Archibasilicae Vaticanae hypogeo inventa Beati Petri apostoli esse putantur: “Bones found in the earth beneath the Vatican Basilica considered to be those of Blessed Peter the Apostle”. It was this same case, containing nine fragments of the bones of the Apostle, that I desired to present to Your Holiness and to the beloved Church of Constantinople over which you preside with such devotion. As I reflected on our mutual determination to advance together towards full communion, and thanked God for the progress already made since our venerable predecessors met in Jerusalem over fifty years ago, I thought of the gift that Patriarch Athenagoras gave to Pope Paul VI: an icon depicting the brothers Peter and Andrew embracing, united in faith and in love of their common Lord . This icon that, at the behest of Pope Paul VI, is displayed today in the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, has become for us a prophetic sign of the restoration of that visible communion between our Churches to which we aspire and for which we fervently pray and work. Hence, in the peace born of prayer, I sensed that it would be highly significant were some fragments of the relics of the Apostle Peter to be placed beside the relics of the Apostle Andrew , who is venerated as the heavenly patron of the Church of Constantinople. I sensed that this thought came to me from the Holy Spirit, who in so many ways prompts Christians to regain that full communion for which our Lord Jesus Christ prayed on the eve of his glorious Passion (cf. Jn 17:21). This gesture is intended to be a confirmation of the journey that our Churches have made in drawing closer to one another: a journey at times demanding and difficult, yet one accompanied by evident signs of God’s grace. Pursuing this journey calls above all for spiritual conversion and renewed fidelity to the Lord who requires on our part greater commitment and new, courageous steps. Difficulties and disagreements, now and in the future, must not distract us from our duty and responsibility as Christians, and particularly as Pastors of the Church, before God and history. The joining of the relics of the two brother Apostles can also serve as a constant reminder and encouragement that, on this continuing journey, our divergences will no longer stand in the way of our common witness and our evangelizing mission in the service of a human family that today is tempted to build a purely secular future, a future without God. Your Holiness, beloved Brother, I have found great comfort in sharing these thoughts with you. In the hope of soon encountering you once more, I ask you to pray for me and to bless me, and I exchange with Your Holiness a fraternal embrace of peace.","pope":"Francis","type":"Letter","year":2019}
{"_id":{"$oid":"61095176ce5ca320689a93f1"},"text":"I am grateful that you have invited me to address you at the beginning of the Conference “Water, agriculture and food: let us build tomorrow”, organized by various academic, social and ecclesial institutions, with the participation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organizations based in Rome. The theme that has brought them together reminds me of the psalmist, who gratefully acknowledges that “The Lord will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest” (Ps 85: 12). In another moment, the prophet Isaiah compares the word of God with the rainwater that soaks the earth, making it germinate “so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater” (55: 10). The rain, the harvest, the food. Biblical wisdom saw a close link between these elements and interpreted them from the perspective of gratitude, never from voracity or exploitation. The faith and experience of believers leads to this recognition, which transforms for us into a pressing call to responsibility, not to be caught in petty calculations that prevent us from helping the less favoured, who are deprived of their most basic needs. In this regard, the subtitle that they wanted to give their thoughts is inspiring, because the word “build” implies a sense of positivity, the contribution of a benefit, openness to the other, reciprocity and collaboration. These key words must not be forgotten, because the tomorrow we all want can only be the result of loyal, supportive and generous cooperation. Indeed, the challenges to humanity at the present time are so complex that they require a sum of ideas, a unity of efforts, a complementarity of perspectives, while renouncing exclusionary selfishness and pernicious protagonism. In this way, sound decisions will be taken and solid foundations can be laid to build a fair and inclusive society in which no-one is left behind. A society that puts the human being and his fundamental rights at the centre, without being led astray by questionable interests that only enrich a few, unfortunately always the same. This will also be the way to ensure that future generations find a harmonious world without quarrels, with the necessary resources to enjoy a dignified and full life. Although the land has resources for everyone, in terms of both quantity and quality, a large number of people suffer from hunger and are cruelly afflicted by poverty. To eradicate these scourges, it would be enough to eliminate injustices and inequities and put in place far-sighted and far-reaching policies, effective and coordinated measures, so that no one may lack daily bread or the means necessary to exist. Among them, water is essential and yet, unfortunately, not everyone has access to it, so it is essential that it be better distributed and managed in a sustainable and rational manner. Likewise it is also unavoidable to ensure the care and protection of the environment, safeguarding its beauty, preserving the copious variety of ecosystems, cultivating the fields with care, without greed and without causing irreversible damage. The earth must be treated with tenderness, so as not to cause it damage, so as not to ruin the work of the hands of the Creator. When this is not done, the earth ceases to be a source of life for the human family. And this is what happens in many regions of our planet, where water is contaminated, garbage accumulates, deforestation advances, air is stale and soil acidified. All this generates a harmful accumulation of ills and miseries, which we also find when food is wasted and not shared; that is why it is essential to educate children and young people to nourish themselves healthily, not simply to eat. Correct nourishment involves knowing the value of food, disengagement from frenzied and compulsive consumerism, and making the table a place for encounter and fraternity, not just the space for ostentation, waste or whims. I ask God the Father that all those who participate in this important Day leave it with a renewed desire to make the earth the common home that welcomes us all, a home of open doors, a place of communion and beneficial coexistence. In this way, the future will be full of light and can be faced by all with confidence and hope, as the fruit of a serene present rich in seeds of virtue and hope. I wish you all the best for your work. I am pleased to impart to you the Apostolic Blessing and I ask you, please, to pray for me.","pope":"Francis","type":"Message","year":2018}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610951bece5ca320689a93f2"},"text":"“When the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son” (Gal 4:4). This celebration of Vespers breathes the atmosphere of the fullness of time. Not because we are at the last evening of the solar year, far from it; but because the faith teaches us to contemplate and feel that Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh, has given fullness to worldly time and human history. “Born of woman” (v. 4). The first to experience the meaning of the fullness given by the presence of Jesus was precisely the “woman” of whom he was “born”: the Mother of the Incarnate Son, Theotokos, Mother of God. The fullness of time flowed forth through her, so to speak: through her humble and faith-filled heart, through her flesh wholly permeated by the Holy Spirit. From her the Church has acquired and constantly acquires this inner perception of fullness, which fosters a sense of gratitude, as a unique human response worthy of the immense Gift of God. A heartrending gratitude which, beginning from the contemplation of that Child swaddled and laid in a manger, extends to everything and to everyone, to the entire world. It is a “gratefulness” which reflects the Grace; it comes not from the ‘we’ but from him; it comes not from the ‘I’ but from God; and it engages the ‘I’ and the ‘we’. In this atmosphere created by the Holy Spirit, we raise to God the thanksgiving for the year that is coming to an end, acknowledging that all good is his gift. Even this moment of the year 2017, which God gave to us whole and healthy, we humans in many ways have squandered and wounded with works of death, with lies and injustice. Wars are a flagrant sign of this recidivist and absurd pride. But so too are all the small and large offenses to life, to truth, to brotherhood, which cause manifold forms of human, social and environmental degradation. We wish to and must assume our responsibility for everything before God, our brothers and sisters and creation. But this evening Jesus’ grace and his reflection in Mary prevail. And therefore gratitude prevails, the gratitude that, as Bishop of Rome, I feel in my heart, thinking of the people who live with open hearts in this city. I feel a sense of fondness and gratitude for all those people who each day contribute, with small but valuable concrete gestures, to the good of Rome: they try as best they can to fulfil their duty; they move through the traffic with discernment and prudence, respecting public places and signaling the things that do not work; they are attentive to people who are elderly or in difficulty, and so on. In these and a thousand other ways they concretely express love for the city. Without speeches, without publicity, but with a style of civic education practiced in daily life. And in this way they quietly cooperate for the common good. Likewise I feel great esteem for the parents, teachers and all educators who, with this same manner, try to form children and young people in civic awareness, in an ethics of responsibility, educating them to feel part of, to take care of, to take an interest in the reality that surrounds them. These people, even if they do not make the news, are the majority of the people who live in Rome. And among them many find themselves in conditions of economic difficulty; and yet they do not complain about it, nor do they harbour resentment and rancour, but they strive each day to do their part to make things a little better. Today, in giving thanks to God, I invite you to also express appreciation for all these artisans of the common good, who love their city not only with words but with deeds.","pope":"Francis","type":"Homilie","year":2017}
{"_id":{"$oid":"61095207ce5ca320689a93f3"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Thank you for your affection! Today, the Second Sunday of Lent, we have a particularly beautiful Gospel, that of the Transfiguration of the Lord. Luke the Evangelist highlights in particular the fact that Jesus was transfigured while he was praying. Jesus experienced a profound relationship with the Father during a sort of spiritual retreat which he made on a high mountain in the company of Peter, James and John, the three disciples ever present at the moments of the Teacher's divine manifestation (Lk 5:10; 8:51; 9:28). The Lord, who had just foretold his death and Resurrection (9:22), granted the disciples a foretaste of his glory. And the heavenly Father’s voice rang out in the Transfiguration, as in the baptism: “this is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!” (9:35). Moreover the presence of Moses and Elijah, who represent the Law and the Prophets of the Old Covenant, is particularly significant: the whole history of the Covenant is oriented to him, Christ, who makes a new “exodus” (9:31), not toward the promised land, as in the time of Moses, but toward Heaven. Peter’s words “Master, it is well that we are here” represent the impossible attempt to put this mystical experience on hold. St Augustine commented: “[Peter]... on the mountain... had Christ as the food of his soul. Why should he have to go down to return to his hard work and sorrows while up there he was filled with sentiments of holy love for God and which thus inspired in him a holy conduct? (Sermon 78,3: pl 38, 491). In meditating on this passage of the Gospel, we can learn a very important lesson from it: first of all, the primacy of prayer, without which the entire commitment to the apostolate and to charity is reduced to activism. In Lent we learn to give the right time to prayer, both personal and of the community, which gives rest to our spiritual life. Moreover, prayer does not mean isolating oneself from the world and from its contradictions, as Peter wanted to do on Mount Tabor; rather, prayer leads back to the journey and to action. “The Christian life”, I wrote in my Message for this Lent, “consists in continuously scaling the mountain to meet God and then coming back down, bearing the love and strength drawn from him, so as to serve our brothers and sisters with God’s own love” (n. 3). Dear brothers and sisters, I hear this word of God as addressed to me in particular at this moment of my life. Thank you! The Lord is calling me “to scale the mountain”, to devote myself even more to prayer and meditation. But this does not mean abandoning the Church; indeed, if God asks me this it is precisely so that I may continue to serve her with the same dedication and the same love with which I have tried to do so until now, but in a way more suited to my age and strength. Let us invoke the intercession of the Virgin Mary: may she help everyone always to follow the Lord Jesus, in prayer and in active charity.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Angelus","year":2013}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6109523dce5ca320689a93f4"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, In a recent Catechesis I spoke of St Catherine of Siena. Today I would like to present to you another less well known Saint who has the same name: St Catherine of Bologna, a very erudite yet very humble woman. She was dedicated to prayer but was always ready to serve; generous in sacrifice but full of joy in welcoming Christ with the Cross. Catherine was born in Bologna on 8 September 1413, the eldest child of Benvenuta Mammolini and John de’ Vigri, a rich and cultured patrician of Ferrara, a doctor in law and a public lector in Padua, where he carried out diplomatic missions for Nicholas III d’Este, Marquis of Ferrara. Not much information about Catherine’s infancy and childhood is available and not all of it is reliable. As a child she lived in her grandparents’ house in Bologna, where she was brought up by relatives, especially by her mother who was a woman of deep faith. With her, Catherine moved to Ferrara when she was about 10 years old and entered the court of Nicholas III d’Este as lady-in-waiting to Margaret, Nicholas’ illegitimate daughter. The Marquis was transforming Ferrara into a fine city, summoning artists and scholars from various countries. He encouraged culture and, although his private life was not exemplary, took great care of the spiritual good, moral conduct and education of his subjects. In Ferrara Catherine was unaware of the negative aspects that are often part and parcel of court life. She enjoyed Margaret’s friendship and became her confidante. She developed her culture by studying music, painting and dancing; she learned to write poetry and literary compositions and to play the viola; she became expert in the art of miniature-painting and copying; she perfected her knowledge of Latin. In her future monastic life she was to put to good use the cultural and artistic heritage she had acquired in these years. She learned with ease, enthusiasm and tenacity. She showed great prudence, as well as an unusual modesty, grace and kindness in her behaviour. However, one absolutely clear trait distinguished her: her spirit, constantly focused on the things of Heaven. In 1427, when she was only 14 years old and subsequent to certain family events, Catherine decided to leave the court to join a group of young noble women who lived a community life dedicating themselves to God. Her mother trustingly consented in spite of having other plans for her daughter. We know nothing of Catherine’s spiritual path prior to this decision. Speaking in the third person, she states that she entered God’s service, “illumined by divine grace... with an upright conscience and great fervour”, attentive to holy prayer by night and by day, striving to acquire all the virtues she saw in others, “not out of envy but the better to please God in whom she had placed all her love” (Le sette armi necessarie alla battaglia spirituali, [The seven spiritual weapons], VII, 8, Bologna 1998, p. 12). She made considerable spiritual progress in this new phase of her life but her trials, her inner suffering and especially the temptations of the devil were great and terrible. She passed through a profound spiritual crisis and came to the brink of despair (cf. ibid., VII, 2, pp. 12-29). She lived in the night of the spirit, and was also deeply shaken by the temptation of disbelief in the Eucharist. After so much suffering, the Lord comforted her: he gave her, in a vision, a clear awareness of the Real Presence in the Eucharist, an awareness so dazzling that Catherine was unable to express it in words (cf. ibid., VIII, 2. pp. 42-46). In this same period a sorrowful trial afflicted the community: tension arose between those who wished to follow the Augustinian spirituality and those who had more of an inclination for Franciscan spirituality. Between 1429 and 1430, Lucia Mascheroni, in charge of the group, decided to found an Augustinian monastery. Catherine, on the other hand chose with others to bind herself to the Rule of St Clare of Assisi. It was a gift of Providence, because the community dwelled in the vicinity of the Church of the Holy Spirit, annexed to the convent of the Friars Minor who had adhered to the movement of the Observance. Thus Catherine and her companions could take part regularly in liturgical celebrations and receive adequate spiritual assistance. They also had the joy of listening to the preaching of St Bernardine of Siena (cf. ibid., VII, 62, p. 26). Catherine recounts that in 1429 — the third year since her conversion — she went to make her confession to one of the Friars Minor whom she esteemed, she made a good Confession and prayed the Lord intensely to grant her forgiveness for all her sins and the suffering connected with them. In a vision God revealed to her that he had forgiven her everything. It was a very strong experience of divine mercy which left an indelible mark upon her, giving her a fresh impetus to respond generously to God’s immense love (cf. ibid. IX, 2, pp. 46-48). In 1431 she had a vision of the Last Judgement. The terrifying spectacle of the damned impelled her to redouble her prayers and penance for the salvation of sinners. The devil continued to assail her and she entrusted herself ever more totally to the Lord and to the Virgin Mary (cf. ibid., X, 3, pp. 53-54). In her writings, Catherine has left us a few essential notes concerning this mysterious battle from which, with God’s grace, she emerged victorious. She did so in order to instruct her sisters and those who intend to set out on the path of perfection: she wanted to put them on their guard against the temptations of the devil who often conceals himself behind deceptive guises, later to sow doubts about faith, vocational uncertainty and sensuality. In her autobiographical and didactic treatise, The Seven Spiritual Weapons, Catherine offers in this regard teaching of deep wisdom and profound discernment. She speaks in the third person in reporting the extraordinary graces which the Lord gives to her and in the first person in confessing her sins. From her writing transpires the purity of her faith in God, her profound humility, the simplicity of her heart, her missionary zeal, her passion for the salvation of souls. She identifies seven weapons in the fight against evil, against the devil: 1. always to be careful and diligently strive to do good; 2. to believe that alone we will never be able to do something truly good; 3. to trust in God and, for love of him, never to fear in the battle against evil, either in the world or within ourselves; 4. to meditate often on the events and words of the life of Jesus, and especially on his Passion and his death; 5. to remember that we must die; 6. to focus our minds firmly on memory of the goods of Heaven; 7. to be familiar with Sacred Scripture, always cherishing it in our hearts so that it may give direction to all our thoughts and all our actions. A splendid programme of spiritual life, today too, for each one of us! In the convent Catherine, in spite of being accustomed to the court in Ferrara, served in the offices of laundress, dressmaker and breadmaker and even looked after the animals. She did everything, even the lowliest tasks, with love and ready obedience, offering her sisters a luminous witness. Indeed she saw disobedience as that spiritual pride which destroys every other virtue. Out of obedience she accepted the office of novice mistress, although she considered herself unfit for this office, and God continued to inspire her with his presence and his gifts: in fact she proved to be a wise and appreciated mistress. Later the service of the parlour was entrusted to her. She found it trying to have to interrupt her prayers frequently in order to respond to those who came to the monastery grill, but this time too the Lord did not fail to visit her and to be close to her. With her the monastery became an increasingly prayerful place of self-giving, of silence, of endeavour and of joy. Upon the death of the abbess, the superiors thought immediately of her, but Catherine urged them to turn to the Poor Clares of Mantua who were better instructed in the Constitutions and in religious observance. Nevertheless, a few years later, in 1456, she was asked at her monastery to open a new foundation in Bologna. Catherine would have preferred to end her days in Ferrara, but the Lord appeared to her and exhorted her to do God’s will by going to Bologna as abbess. She prepared herself for the new commitment with fasting, scourging and penance. She went to Bologna with 18 sisters. As superior she set the example in prayer and in service; she lived in deep humility and poverty. At the end of her three-year term as abbess she was glad to be replaced but after a year she was obliged to resume her office because the newly elected abbess became blind. Although she was suffering and and was afflicted with serious ailments that tormented her, she carried out her service with generosity and dedication. For another year she urged her sisters to an evangelical life, to patience and constancy in trial, to fraternal love, to union with the divine Bridegroom, Jesus, so as to prepare her dowry for the eternal nuptials. It was a dowry that Catherine saw as knowing how to share the sufferings of Christ, serenely facing hardship, apprehension, contempt and misunderstanding (cf. Le sette armi spirituali, X, 20, pp. 57-58). At the beginning of 1463 her health deteriorated. For the last time she gathered the sisters in Chapter, to announce her death to them and to recommend the observance of the Rule. Towards the end of February she was harrowed by terrible suffering that was never to leave her, yet despite her pain it was she who comforted her sisters, assuring them that she would also help them from Heaven. After receiving the last Sacraments, she give her confessor the text she had written: The Seven Spiritual Weapons, and entered her agony; her face grew beautiful and translucent; she still looked lovingly at those who surrounded her and died gently, repeating three times the name of Jesus. It was 9 March 1463 (cf. I. Bembo, Specchio di illuminazione, Vita di S. Caterina a Bologna, Florence 2001, chap. III). Catherine was to be canonized by Pope Clement XI on 22 May 1712. Her incorrupt body is preserved in the city of Bologna, in the chapel of the monastery of Corpus Domini. Dear friends, with her words and with her life, St Catherine of Bologna is a pressing invitation to let ourselves always be guided by God, to do his will daily, even if it often does not correspond with our plans, to trust in his Providence which never leaves us on our own. In this perspective, St Catherine speaks to us; from the distance of so many centuries she is still very modern and speaks to our lives. She, like us, suffered temptations, she suffered the temptations of disbelief, of sensuality, of a difficult spiritual struggle. She felt forsaken by God, she found herself in the darkness of faith. Yet in all these situations she was always holding the Lord’s hand, she did not leave him, she did not abandon him. And walking hand in hand with the Lord, she walked on the right path and found the way of light. So it is that she also tells us: take heart, even in the night of faith, even amidst our many doubts, do not let go of the Lord’s hand, walk hand in hand with him, believe in God’s goodness. This is how to follow the right path! And I would like to stress another aspect: her great humility. She was a person who did not want to be someone or something; she did not care for appearances, she did not want to govern. She wanted to serve, to do God’s will, to be at the service of others. And for this very reason Catherine was credible in her authority, because she was able to see that for her authority meant, precisely, serving others. Let us ask God, through the intercession of Our Saint, for the gift to achieve courageously and generously the project he has for us, so that he alone may be the firm rock on which our lives are built. Thank you.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Audience","year":2010}

The solemn decision to lay the foundation stone of a monument commemorating this event on Mount Aymond, the frontier between the two countries, gives me the opportunity to recall those days at the beginning of December 1978, when the leaders of the two beloved nations concluded that all the possibilities of reaching an agreement that would put an end to their age-old dispute had been exhausted. It seemed to them even more difficult to accept the suggestion the Pontiff had made to them in his Message of 11 December, since he insisted on a calm and responsible examination of the problem so that the requirements of justice, equity and prudence would prevail as the sure and stable foundation of fraternal coexistence among the Chilean and Argentine peoples. Aware of both nations' profound desire for peace, which for some time had been presented to the Supreme Pontiff by the respective Pastors of these two countries with a deeply-rooted Catholic tradition, John Paul II, impelled by his particular sensitivity to carry out the mission received from the Prince of Peace, felt the need to make a new and special intervention of a more personal nature. It is well known that his decision, announced on 22 December 1978, to send Cardinal Antonio Samoré to the respective capitals, providentially halted the war and brought, concluding the mission faithfully and generously accomplished by the unforgettable Cardinal, to signing the Act of Montevideo at Palacio Taranco, on 8 January 1979. These Agreements included a wager on peace decided by the two governments. This was expressed in their petition to the Successor of St Peter, in which they asked him to act as mediator, to guide them in the negotiations and help them in their quest for a lasting solution to their differences. The acceptance of this request, whose needs went far beyond the initial provisions of a possible commitment by the Pope and the normal praxis of the Holy See's international activity, was in fact the first step on the long and complex journey of mediation in which Cardinal Samoré's action as personal Representative of the Supreme Pontiff, together with his collaborators and the delegations of both countries and under the direction of their authority, led to the felicitous solution of the controversy over the southern zone with the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship. Thus I would now like to join with the Presidents of both countries' gratitude and joy in the special celebration of this historical date. They are grateful for the work of my Predecessor who so distinguished himself during his long Pontificate for promoting concord among all peoples. This success, causing a pleasant and unexpected surprise in the world, is an example of how, in the face of any controversy, it is always necessary to overcome discouragement and not to abandon the process of patient dialogue and negotiation, conducted with wisdom and prudence, in order to reach a just and worthy solution by peaceful means proper to civilized peoples, especially when their members know that they are also brothers and sisters, children of one God and Father. Recent history, with the experience of various fatally failed attempts and drastic solutions which in controversies in various parts of the world have given rise to very grave consequences, helps us to discover the horrors which that Papal intervention spared the Argentine and Chilean peoples, as well as other nations in the region. And today's reality, with the abundant positive results of mutual collaboration between the two countries and which are an exemplary and undeniable proof of the fruits of peace, began to emerge precisely 30 years ago. While I thank God for the many benefits received through his Son, the Prince of Peace, and through the intercession of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, with her titles of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Luján, I cordially impart a special Apostolic Blessing to the noble nations of Chile and Argentina.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Letter","year":2008}

I greet Cardinal Adrianus Simonis, Archbishop of Utrecht and President of the Bishops' Conference, and all the Dutch Bishops, expressing deep appreciation for the organization of this propitious initiative. I would then like to thank the Werkgroep Katholieke Jongeren for its work in these years and the priests and lay people involved in the pastoral care of youth, who are following you in your reflection. With this Message, dear young people, I wish to make myself spiritually present among you and to assure you that I accompany you in prayer. I know that a great many of you took part in the World Meeting at Cologne and it therefore gives me great joy that you now want to continue the experience that began with World Youth Day, involving others of your age who did not have the grace to take part in it. Holding today's meeting at the invitation of your Bishops is a very beautiful sign for Dutch society: it means that you are not afraid to say that you are Christians and want to witness to it openly. In fact, the deepest reason for your gathering together is to encounter the Lord Jesus Christ. This is how it was for those who took part in the recent World Youth Day, whose theme was: \"We have come to worship him\" (Mt 2: 2). In the footsteps of the Magi, impelled by the yearning to seek the truth, young people from every corner of the earth met in Cologne to seek and worship God made Man, and then, transformed by their encounter with him and illumined by his presence, they returned to their country, like the Magi, \"by another route\" (Mt 2: 12). So it was that you returned to Holland, eager to communicate to one and all your rich experience, and today you want to share it with your peers. Dear friends, Jesus is your true friend and Lord; enter into a relationship of true friendship with him! He is expecting you and in him alone will you find happiness. How easy it is to be content with the superficial pleasures that daily life offers us; how easy it is to live only for oneself, apparently enjoying life! But sooner or later we realize that this is not true happiness, because true happiness is much deeper: we find it only in Jesus. As I said in Cologne, \"The happiness you are seeking, the happiness you have a right to enjoy, has a name and a face: it is Jesus of Nazareth\" (Address at the Poller Rheinwiesen Wharf, 18 August 2005; L'Osservatore Romano English edition, 24 August, p. 4). I therefore invite you every day to seek the Lord, who wants nothing more than for you to be truly happy. Foster an intense and constant relationship with him in prayer and, when possible, find suitable moments in your day to be alone in his company. If you do not know how to pray, ask him to teach you, and ask your heavenly Mother to pray with you and for you. The recitation of the Rosary can help you learn the art of prayer with Mary's simplicity and depth. It is important that you make participation in the Eucharist, in which Jesus gives himself for us, the heart of your life. He who died for the sins of all desires to enter into communion with each one of you and is knocking at the doors of your hearts to give you his grace. Go to the encounter with him in the Blessed Eucharist, go to adore him in the churches, kneeling before the Tabernacle: Jesus will fill you with his love and will reveal to you the thoughts of his Heart. If you listen to him, you will feel ever more deeply the joy of belonging to his Mystical Body, the Church, which is the family of his disciples held close by the bond of unity and love. You will also learn, as the Apostle Paul says, to let yourselves be reconciled with God (cf. II Cor 5: 20). Especially in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, Jesus waits for you to forgive you your sins and reconcile you with his love through the ministry of the priest. By confessing your sins humbly and truthfully, you will receive the pardon of God himself through the words of his minister. What a great opportunity the Lord has given us with this sacrament to renew ourselves from within and to progress in our Christian life! I recommend that you make good use of it all the time! Dear friends, as I said to you above, if you follow Jesus, you will never feel lonely because you are part of the Church, which is a great family in which you can grow in true friendship with so many brothers and sisters in the faith scattered in every part of the world. Jesus needs you to \"renew\" contemporary society. Take care to grow in the knowledge of the faith in order to be its authentic witnesses. Dedicate yourselves to understanding Catholic doctrine ever better: even if at times in looking at it with the eyes of the world it may seem a difficult message to accept, in it is the answer that satisfies your basic questions. Trust your Pastors and guides, Bishops and priests; become actively involved in the parishes, movements, associations and Ecclesial Communities to experience together the joy of being followers of Christ, who proclaims and gives truth and love. And truly impelled by his truth and love, you will be able, together with other young people who are seeking the true meaning of life, to build a better future for all. Dear friends, I am close to you with my prayers. May you generously accept the call of the Lord, who holds up to you great ideals that can make your lives beautiful and full of joy. You can be certain of it: only by responding positively to his appeal, however demanding it may seem to you, is it possible to find happiness and peace of heart. May the Virgin Mary accompany you on this journey of Christian commitment, and may she help you in all your good resolutions. With these sentiments, I cordially impart a special Apostolic Blessing to all of you who are gathered in Nieuwegein, as well as to those who accompany you with love and wisdom on your path of human and spiritual growth.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Message","year":2005}
{"_id":{"$oid":"61095370ce5ca320689a93f7"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters! 1. In an atmosphere of Christmas joy, today we are celebrating the Feast of the Holy Family. This year it falls on 31 December, the last day of the year. Is it not providential that the Year 2000, the year that seals a millennium, should end in the sign of the family? We turn our gaze from the crib to the humble dwelling of Nazareth. Having become our brother, Jesus wanted to experience family life. Thus he became part of the first, fundamental cell of society, in this way giving perennially valid recognition to the most common of human institutions. For us believers, the family, a reflection of Trinitarian communion, finds its model in the family of Nazareth, where the human history of the Redeemer and his parents unfolded. We think of the difficulties Mary and Joseph had to face at Jesus' birth and then during their exile in Egypt to escape Herod's persecution. Nazareth has also become the symbol of that \"normality\" of daily life which marks every family's existence. 2. Looking today at that Holy House, our thoughts turn to the many families of our time who are in difficult situations. Some of them suffer from extreme poverty; others are forced to seek in foreign countries what they unfortunately lack in their homeland; still others find within their own families serious problems caused by the rapid cultural and social changes which at times overwhelm them. And what can be said of the many attacks on the family institution itself? All this shows how urgent it is to rediscover the value of the family and to help it in every way to be, as God wanted it, the vital environment where every child who comes into the world is welcomed with tenderness and gratitude from the moment of his conception; a place marked by a serene atmosphere that encourages the harmonious human and spiritual development of all its members. May the Holy Family, whom we venerate today, obtain this gift for every family and help them to be a little \"domestic church\", a school of human and religious virtues. 3. Today, 31 December, another year of our life and history is coming to an end. A year which is certainly unique, because it is the Great Jubilee year, in which we have seen signs of good will in so many men and women, as well as a genuine desire for reconciliation with God and neighbour. As this year draws to a close, let us invoke the Lord's forgiveness for the shortcomings that have marked our personal and community life. Only in this way can our thanksgiving for the many benefits we have received be true and sincere. And there are truly many reasons why we feel that we must thank the Lord at the end of this Year 2000. Let us do so, through Mary, with the Angelus prayer. After leading the recitation of the Angelus, the Holy Father greeted the pilgrims and faithful. I affectionately greet the pilgrims here today. I would especially like to mention the faithful from Giulianello and Cori in the Province of Latina. Dear friends, you have organized your traditional procession of Wise Men on horseback with flag-bearers; I gladly bless your journey, which will take you to the revered image of the Child Jesus at Giulianello di Cori. My most cordial wishes for peace and goodness to everyone.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Angelus","year":2000}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610953fcce5ca320689a93f8"},"text":"Mr Chairman, Mr Director General, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1. I gladly welcome the distinguished participants in the Twenty–eighth Conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, making your now traditional visit to the See of Peter. Because this year marks the Fiftieth Anniversary of FAO, I am especially pleased that, despite your busy schedule, you did not wish to miss this occasion–a custom which was been honoured at meetings of the Conference since FAO settled in Rome in 1951. Through you, Mr Chairman, I offer warm good wishes to the Delegates and Representatives of the member States, and extend a special welcome to the new members of your Organization which more than ever reflects a world which, in spite of often painful divisions, has an increasing need to unite around common objectives. I thank you, Mr Director–General, and renew my esteem for your generous commitment during the first phase of your mandate, which also involves the difficult but necessary task of restructuring the Organization. 2. It is not by chance that the beginning of FAO coincided with the formation of that broader Organization, the United Nations, whose ideals inspired FAO and with whose activity it is associated. The establishment of FAO was thus intended to emphasize the complementarity of the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations: true peace and effective international security are achieved not only by preventing wars and conflicts, but also by promoting development and creating conditions which ensure that basic human rights are fully guaranteed. 3. The Fiftieth Anniversary celebration of FAO offers a suitable occasion to reflect on the international community’s commitment to a fundamental good and duty: the freeing of human beings from malnutrition and the threat of starvation. As you have pointed out in the recent Quebec Declaration, it cannot be forgotten that at the origins of FAO there was not only a desire to strengthen effective cooperation among States in a primary sector such as agriculture but also the intention to find ways to guarantee sufficient food for the whole world, through sharing the fruits of the earth in a rational way. By setting up FAO on 16 October 1945, the world community hoped to eradicate the scourge of famine and starvation. The enormous difficulties still involved in this task must not be allowed to diminish the firmness of your commitment. Even today tragic situations are unfolding before our eyes: people are dying of starvation because peace and security have not been guaranteed. The social and economic situation of the contemporary world makes us all aware of the extent to which the hunger and malnutrition of millions of people are the result of evil mechanisms within economic structures, or are the consequence of unjust criteria in the distribution of resources and production, policies formulated in order to safeguard special interest groups, or different forms of protectionism. Furthermore, the precarious situation in which whole peoples find themselves has led to a mobility of such alarming dimensions that it cannot be dealt with by traditional humanitarian assistance alone. The question of refugees and displaced persons gives rise to dramatic consequences at the level of agricultural production and of food security, affecting the nutrition of millions of people. FAO’s action in recent years has shown that the provision of emergency help for refugees is not enough; this kind of assistance does not bring a satisfactory solution as long as conditions of extreme poverty are allowed to continue and become even more acute, conditions which lead to increased deaths due to malnutrition and hunger. The underlying causes of such situations have to be addressed. 4. Ladies and Gentlemen: the Fiftieth Anniversary celebrations furnish us with the opportunity to ask why international action, despite the existence of FAO, has been unable to alter this state of affairs. At the world–wide level sufficient food can be produced to satisfy everyone’s needs. Why then are so many people threatened by starvation? As you are well aware, there are many reasons for this paradoxical situation in which abundance coexists with scarcity, including policies which forcibly reduce agricultural production, widespread corruption in public life, and massive investment in sophisticated weapons systems to the detriment of people’s primary needs. These and other reasons contribute to the creation of what you call \"structures of famine\". Here we are speaking of the mechanisms of international business by which the less favoured countries, those most in need of food, are excluded in one way or another from the market, thus preventing a just and effective distribution of agricultural products. Yet another reason is that certain forms of assistance for development are made conditional on the implementation by poorer countries of policies of structural adjustment, policies which drastically limit those countries’ ability to acquire needed foodstuffs. Nor can a serious analysis of the underlying causes of hunger overlook that attitude found in the more developed countries, where a consumerist culture tends to exalt artificial needs over real ones. This has direct consequences for the structure of the world economy, and for agriculture and food production in particular. These many reasons have their source not only in a false sense of the values which should sustain international relations, but also in a widespread attitude which emphasizes having over being. The result is a real inability on the part of many to appreciate the needs of the poor and the starving; indeed, to appreciate the poor themselves in their inalienable human dignity. An effective campaign against hunger thus calls for more than merely indicating the proper functioning of market mechanisms or attaining higher levels of food production. It is necessary, first and foremost, to recover a sense of the human person. In my Address to the General Assembly of the United Nations on 5 October last, I pointed to the need to build relationships between peoples on the basis of a constant \"exchange of gifts\", a real \"culture of giving\" which should make every country prepared to meet the needs of the less fortunate (John Paul II, Message to the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization, 14). 5. In this perspective, FAO and other bodies have an essential role to play in fostering a new sense of international cooperation. During the last fifty years it has been the merit of FAO to promote people’s access to land, thus favouring agricultural workers and fostering their rights as a condition for raising production levels. Food assistance, often exploited as a way of exerting political pressure, has been modified by means of a new concept: food security, which considers the availability of food not only in relation to the needs of a country’s population, but also in relation to the productive capacity of neighbouring areas, precisely with a view to the rapid transfer or exchange of foodstuffs. In addition, the concern which the international community shows for environmental issues is reflected in FAO’s involvement in activities aimed at limiting damage to the ecosystem and safeguarding food production from phenomena such as desertification and erosion. The promotion of effective social justice in relations between peoples entails the awareness that the goods of Creation are meant for all people, and that the economic life of the world community should be oriented to sharing those goods, their use and their benefits. Today it is more necessary than ever for the international community to recommit itself to fulfilling the primary purpose for which FAO was established. Daily bread for every person on earth – that \"Fiat panis\" which FAO refers to in its motto – is an essential condition of the world’s peace and security. Courageous choices must be made, choices made in the light of a correct ethical vision of political and economic activity. Modifications and reforms of the international system, and of FAO in particular, need to be rooted in an ethic of solidarity and a culture of sharing. To direct the labours of this Conference to this end can be a most fruitful way of preparing for the important meeting of the World Summit on Nutrition which FAO has scheduled for November 1996. 6. In all these efforts the Catholic Church is close to you, as attested to by the attention with which the Holy See has followed the activity of FAO since 1948. In celebrating this Fiftieth Anniversary with you, the Holy See wishes to demonstrate its continuing support for your endeavours. A symbolic sign of this support and encouragement will be the bell to be placed in the FAO headquarters as a remembrance of the establishment, fifty years ago, of the Family of the United Nations. Bells symbolize joy; they announce an event. But bells also ring out a call to action. On this occasion, and in the context of FAO’s activity, this bell is meant to call everyone – countries, different International Organizations, all men and women of goodwill – to even greater efforts to free the world from famine and malnutrition. The words inscribed on the base of the bell evoke the very purpose of the United Nations system: \"Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\" (Is. 2: 4). These are the words of the Prophet Isaiah, who proclaimed the dawn of universal peace. But, according to the Prophet, this peace will come about – and this has great meaning for FAO – only when \"they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks\" (Is. 2: 4). For only when people consider the struggle against hunger as a priority, and are committed to providing everyone with the means of gaining their daily bread instead of amassing weapons, will conflicts and wars come to an end and humanity be able to set forth on a lasting journey of peace. This is the sublime task to which you, the Representatives of the Nations and the leaders of FAO, are called. Upon your work and upon FAO, I invoke the abundant blessings of Almighty God, ever rich in mercy.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Letter","year":1995}
{"_id":{"$oid":"61095447ce5ca320689a93f9"},"text":"His Excellency, Mr. Dante Caputo President of the 43rd General Assembly of the United Nations. 1. On December 10, 1948, when it adopted and published the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the General Assembly of the United Nations had the intention of responding to the concerns of an age during which \"disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind. \" The General Assembly wished also to affirm that one of the highest human aspirations is to see the dignity of the human person recognized, and it looked forward to the coming of a world in which all could exercise freedom of speech and freedom of belief. In this sense, the Declaration expressed a common ideal to be attained by all peoples and all nations, by undertaking progressive steps on the national and international levels. The celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Declaration offers a fresh chance to see how well the ideals adopted by the greater part of the international Community of peoples in 1948 have been respected, and also to evaluate the concrete development of human rights and freedoms in various national legislation and, even more, in the conscience of individuals and groups. 2. I know that in the course of the intervening 40 years some important initiatives have been undertaken by the United Nations, and that considerable efforts have been provided to support the ideals of the Declaration and to establish the proper juridical instruments to set in motion its fundamental principles. Without doubt that is to the credit of the United Nations. But the end of the road has not been reached as yet, as witnessed by the numerous efforts of the \"ad hoc\" Committees, established to clarify further the application of the principles, to work out adequate juridical instruments and examine violations of human rights wherever they are committed. 3. In that spirit, it is indispensable that public officials act with renewed determination so that States guarantee the concrete enjoyment of human rights for their citizens. This is the only means through which the higher degree of civilization, desired by the writers of the Declaration, can be reached. How can one not acknowledge that today, in reality, hundreds of millions of human beings still see their rights to life, liberty and security continually threatened, that the equality of all and the dignity of each is not respected, and that certain new barriers are being set up for reasons linked to race, color, sex, language, religion, political views or other convictions, and national or social origin? Furthermore what should be said about certain violations which are more subtle, but which likewise strike a blow at the rights of human persons or groups? 4. For her part, the Church has received from her founder Jesus Christ the duty to proclaim the equal dignity of all persons as children of God. She has not failed, in the course of these 40 years, to reaffirm the transcendent foundations of human rights and to encourage the dynamic activities undertaken in our day to enhance these rights. According to Church teaching, the rights of man are based upon God the Creator; He has bestowed intelligence and freedom on every person; He has willed that society's structures be placed at the service of man. Mr. President, in the present circumstances, I am happy to renew to the United Nations my best wishes that their activities in the service of human rights be fruitful, for these rights form the basis of a just social order and are, as well, a common ideal to be striven for. I am convinced that this activity is contributing very effectively toward strengthening the world's paths toward a peace that is firmly established, and that this is the best response to the essential aspirations conveyed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":1988}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610954aece5ca320689a93fa"},"text":" To Mr Giorgio Balladore Pallieri President of the European Court for Human Rights and to Mr Tames E.S. Fawcelt President of the European Commission for Human Rights 1. The originality and strength of the European Convention on Human Rights lie in the fact that it has made provision - thus serving as models for other international instruments to come - for particular organisms the specific task of which is to see to the protection of violated rights. It is a question, on the one hand, of the European Commission for Human Rights and, on the other hand, of the European Court for Human Rights of which you are celebrating today the 25th and the 20th anniversary respectively. The meritorious and delicate activity of these two organisms aims at ensuring respect for the guarantees provided by the Convention, by opening for persons who complain of having been victims of a violation of human rights, access to supranational authorities. In this connection, my venerated predecessor, Pope Paul VI, receiving, on 7 November 1975, participants in the IV international Colloquy on the European Convention for Human Rights, had already said: \"Outside such guarantees - as we can see, unfortunately, every day - the finest declarations, of which mankind could be proud, run the risk of having no effect; and the voice of victims of violation of rights, even if it sometimes has some echo in international public opinion, can be mocked with impunity in their own country. 2. But today it is not just a question of recalling the importance of this device, the exemplary value of which, alone, would be sufficient to justify this celebration. The occasion that gathers today so many eminent personalities from the various member countries of the Council of Europe, has not a purely formal character. It seems to be inspired also by a deeper sense, because its goal is the dignity of the human person. Does not the ultimate reason for your commemoration lie in that? Is it not a question of a tribute paid to the dignity of the human person, as a fundamental value which the states that signed the European Convention wished to defend and promote? They saw in it perceptively the unquestionable basis on which to edify, in a stable and lasting way all initiatives in the field of the construction of Europe. Allow me to return to the words I uttered in my recent address to the United Nations: \"All these human rights taken together are in keeping with the substance of the dignity of the human being, understood in his entirety, not as reduced to one dimension only. These rights concern the satisfaction of man's essential needs, the exercise of his freedoms, and his relationships with others; but always and everywhere they concern man, they concern man's full human dimension\". 3. In a world context in which the person seems to obtain less and less attention because he is subordinated to ideological and economic systems that enslave and exploit him, it is all the more necessary to reaffirm forcefully that his dignity must remain intact. It is on this conception of the dignity of the person that the various categories of human rights are founded: \"civil and political\" rights as well as \"economic, social and cultural\" rights, to use the terminology of the international Pacts now in force. We must not lose heart when confronted by the apparently insuperable difficulties that emerge from the examination of so many flagrant situations in which human rights are mocked. We must remain convinced that any assault on human dignity, even the most remote one, has repercussions, imperceptible but real ones, on the life of everyone, for an indelible bond unites all human beings. This bond exists for all believers - Christians, Moslems and Jews - and is derived from their faith in the one true God who, as Father of all men, is the source and foundation of human dignity (cf. Declaration Nostra Aetate n. 5). For those who have been called to share Christian faith, this bond is summed up in the words: we are all brothers in Jesus Christ. From this Europe in which Christianity became so deeply rooted throughout its tormented history - in which the lights were not, however, without shadows - there must radiate the moral strength which, alone. can animate the will to respect, defend and promote the dignity of the human person within its frontiers and in solidarity with all those who need it, elsewhere. The organisms whose anniversary is being celebrated today, make an essential contribution to the accomplishment of this great and noble task, because they are a concrete and credible sign of it. May God bless the efforts of all those who, with such dedication and competence are cooperating in the beneficial results of the work of the European Commission and Court for Human Rights.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":1979}

Thanks to the Romans, to the kindness of the Mayor and some authorities of the Italian Government, it was a joyful moment for me. On the contrary, it was not joyful but painful to learn from the newspapers a few days ago that a Roman student had been killed for a trivial reason, in cold blood. It is one of the many cases of violence which are continually afflicting this poor and restless society of ours. The case of Luca Locci, a seven-year-old boy kidnapped three months ago, has come up again in the last few days. People sometimes say: \"we are in a society that is all rotten, all dishonest.\" That is not true. There are still so many good people, so many honest people. Rather, what can be done to improve society? I would say: let each of us try to be good and to infect others with a goodness imbued with the meekness and love taught by Christ. Christ's golden rule was: \"do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself. Do to others what you want done to yourself.\" 'And he always gave. Put on the cross, not only did he forgive those who crucified him, but he excused them. He said: \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.\" This is Christianity, these are sentiments which, if put into practice would help society so much. This year is the thirtieth anniversary of the death of Georges Bernanos, a great Catholic writer. One of his best-known works is \"Dialogues of the Carmelites\". It was published year after his death. He had prepared it working on a story of the German authoress, Gertrud von Le Fort. He had prepared it for the theatre. It went on the stage. It was set to music and then shown on the screens of the whole world. It became extremely well known. The fact, however, was a historical one. Pius X, in 1906, right here in Rome, had beatified the sixteen Carmelites of Compiègne, martyrs during the French revolution. During the trial they were condemned \"to death for fanaticism\". And one of them asked in her simplicity: \"Your Honour, what does fanaticism mean?\" And the judge: \"It is your foolish membership of religion.\" \"Oh, Sisters, she then said, did you hear, we are condemned for our attachment to faith. What happiness to die for Jesus Christ!\" They were brought out of the prison of the Conciergerie, and made to climb into the fatal cart. On the way they sang hymns; when they reached the guillotine, one after the other knelt before the Prioress and renewed the vow of obedience. Then they struck up \"Veni Creator\"; the song, however, became weaker and weaker, as the heads of the poor Sisters fell, one by one, under the guillotine. The Prioress, Sister Theresa of St Augustine, was the last, and her last words were the following: \"Love will always be victorious, love can do everything.\" That was the right word, not violence, but love, can do everything. Let us ask the Lord for the grace that a new wave of love for our neighbour may sweep over this poor world.","pope":"John Paul I","type":"Angelus","year":1978}

Undoubtedly, it is clear to everyone that there is an immense responsibi1ity on the part of all, before history and God Himself, to put to good account the extraordinary opportunities offered by the communications media to help young people to inform and form themselves, to bring out the real problems of the world, to seek the authentic values of life and to live up to their calling as individual persons and Christians. It is, indeed, a burning issue for all men of good will, for private organizations both national and international, for the Church no less; all are to ask themselves: what are the young people of tomorrow going to be like as they grow up in the world being constructed today? And you, young people, what kind of society will you, yourselves construct when the destiny of the world will have passed into your own hands? Dear sons and daughters, in the full consciousness of Our pastoral responsibility, We wish to say to you all: tomorrow will be precisely what we shall have made it with the grace of God. Need We call to mind once again, now that the phenomenon is assuming ever larger proportions, that the press, motion pictures, radio and television are tending to hide, perhaps even supplant, what the traditional vehicles of culture, that is, contacts at home, at school and in the parish, as well as the teaching of educators, used to allow past generations to hand down to their heirs. These days it is the media of social communications that provide new sources of knowledge and culture, with their considerable power of moving men's feelings and minds, together with the train of ideas and stirrings of the imagination carried by the sounds and sights they transmit. Truly they are wonderful means for broadening one's outlook, establishing contacts, communicating and sharing. Obviously however, only as long as they remain in actual fact means to an end, the one end worthy of the name: the service of the whole of mankind and of the whole man (cf. Populorum Progressio, no. 14). Unfortunately, all too often, the contrary is the case. We witness young people and children, used as easily-secured consumers by an industry that makes itself its own end, being dragged into the pit-falls of eroticism and violence or led along the perilous paths of incertitude, anxiety and anguish. It is not asking too much that all right thinking persons should unite at last to sound a cry of alarm and to put an end to enterprises that deserve to be called corrupting. Who is unaware of the urgency of putting to good account the means of social communication with their stirring mode of address through sound, image, color and movement, to make of them real modern instruments for communing among men, that measure up to the expectations of young people? What excellent fare they can provide, so long as it is wholesome and the organism prepared to receive it and assimilate it without being intoxicated! Undoubtedly, they have a great deal to offer to youth: choice of recreation, a wealth of information, for some the beginnings of an education before they can even read or write. We wish to stress this during this \"World Year of Education\" promoted by the United Nations at the opening of the second decade of development. The communications media are capable of providing youth with access to a culture of quality as well as a taste for the authentic values of brotherhood, peace, justice and general welfare. This is an enormous task, a truly glorious enterprise, for all who set in motion these exceptionally powerful instruments for the service of youth. All this however, will not take us far, unless parents and educators play their part in helping young people to choose, to judge and to assimilate what is presented to them, so that they too can become complete human persons and Christians. Not much can be achieved if the young people themselves remain passive as though under the spell of these powerful attractions, held captive by desire and incapable of self-control. Finally, we ask ourselves: who is it that can bring to youth this message of true life, the sincere and courageous word that they consciously unconsciously seek? Millions of men have shared the same thrill before the images brought to them of man's first steps on the moon. Who is it that can bring them to experience together the same deep emotion before the God of love Who came down to walk on our earth as a man, \"to call us all to participate as sons in the life of the Living God, Father of all men\"? (cf. P.P., N. 21) We lend our words of warm encouragement to the numerous pastors of souls, priests, religious and lay people who with true zeal endeavour to seek through the communications media a new language, and find it they must, to announce to the young the Good-News, that always remains astounding. No one will doubt that the young people of today really await this announcement. They yearn for this witness. They too know how to recognize, with profound joy, Him Who is the answer to their most radical and disquiting questionings, Who \"for us has become wisdom, justice, sanctification and redemption\" (1. Cor., I,30). \"Young people, seek Christ, in order to remain young (St. Augustine, Ad fratres in eremo, Sermon 44): this is our hope, this is our prayer. With the earnest wish that parents, educators and all communicators through the media will make the best of the opportunity offered by the World Day specially dedicated to them, for beneficial reflection and fruitful resolutions for the greater advantage of youth, We address to all Our affectionate and confident Apostolic Blessing.","pope":"Paul VI","type":"Message","year":1970}

We wholeheartedly lend the moral support of Our encouragement to this noble effort. The lot of those who live exiled far from their fatherland has always attracted the maternal solicitude of the Catholic Church in a very special way, for she cannot forget the words of Christ, her divine founder: «I was a stranger and you took me in; naked and you covered me . . . I was in prison and you came to me» (Matt. 25, 35-36). As everyone knows, hundreds of thousands of refugees are, for various reasons, victims of the turmoil of recent years, and are still detained in camps, housed in huts, humbled in their dignity as men, and exposed at times to circumstances provocative of severe temptations of discouragement and despair. What generous man can remain indifferent to the spectacle of so many men, women, and even children being deprived of some of their most basic human rights, through no fault of their own; of families disbanded against their will, husbands separated from their wives, and children kept far from their parents… What a pitiful anomaly for modern society, so proud of its technical and social progress! Every individual is duty bound to become aware of this situation and to do what he can to abolish it. What is there that was not done for the refugees of World War I by Benedict XV, whose generous heart was so keenly sensitive to human distress? Then, in his turn, what is there that Our immediate Predecessor, Pius XII, did not do for refugees during the last war? For he too was extremely compassionate toward human suffering and sensitive to every breach of natural law! How many times did not the Holy See intervene on an international plane! What efforts did not the Holy See make and what assistance of all kinds came from Vatican City during those tragic years! We Ourselves were a deeply moved witness and an instrument for some of this work, which achieved such a variety of good results. Called to inherit this precious legacy of charity and of defense of the poor, which is one of the most beautiful jewels of the Catholic Church, We, in Our turn, raise Our voice in behalf of refugees and paternally exhort Our sons in every corner of the world to work generously and diligently for the success of this world-wide Refugee Year. It is a Year which is inspired by noble and disinterested intentions and We are pleased to render homage to it. Let all then strive, according to their ability, to improve the lot of their unfortunate brothers, mindful of the fact that their attachment to the Church and to Christ has in many a case not been unrelated to their present trials. And should one or the other – which God forbid – be tempted to close his heart to this appeal, let him remember the grave warning of Our Predecessor: «Ought not you who remain indifferent to the anguishes of the refugee, who is wandering about without a roof over his head, consider yourselves responsible for him; for his miserable lot today may well be yours tomorrow?» (Pius XII, 1950 Christmas Message, AAS 43 [1951] p. 56) We especially exhort pastors of souls to call the attention of their faithful to this invitation by divine Providence to manifest their sentiments of Christian charity. Since private initiative is powerless of itself to resolve problems of this amplitude, We are confident that public authority will, during this year, be interested in further pursuing and intensifying the efforts which have so laudably been begun in this field. Important results, We know, have already been accomplished on an international scale, notably the formulation and adoption by a rather considerable number of States of the Convention of 1951 regarding the Statute of Refugees. May these States, and others following their lead, open their frontiers ever more generously and work with dispatch for the human and social redistribution of so many unfortunate people. May these latter soon enjoy what they so ardently desire, namely, a respectable existence in the country that hospitably adopts them and the peaceful enjoyment of their personal and family rights. On all those individuals and groups who will hasten the fulfillment of this very desirable goal by working in some way–as We shall do according to Our means–for the success of the world-wide Refugee Year, We lovingly invoke the protection and the special favors of the all powerful and merciful God.","pope":"John XXIII","type":"Message","year":1959}

We are also aware that the respect for the Holy See to which your presence attests is heightened today by the delicacy with which your Majesty postponed for several weeks the trip you proposed to make to the Eternal City. This decision was especially affected by the great loss which disturbed Christianity and echoed sadly throughout the world. We are indeed aware of this attention of your Majesty, of this tribute which you rendered under these circumstances to the memory of the illustrious late Pontiff. It was Our venerated predecessor who received you on your previous visit ten years ago, and We know the faithful memory that your Majesty preserves of that audience. It was he also who more recently agreed to the establishment of official relations between Iran and the Holy See, which We on Our part are happy to support with all Our power. We should like to salute in the person of your Majesty the entire nation of Iran over which you preside with such distinction. Although We have not personally had the privilege of getting to know your country and its capital, dominated by the imposing heights of the Elburz mountains, We once did approach its frontiers. Contained between two seas, guarded by high mountain ranges, this land was in the course of centuries the crossroads of numerous peoples and the crucible of the oldest civilizations. In our day she remains rich in resources, those of the soil and subsoil and those still more precious riches of the mind. To these last the Church, present in these lands from her beginnings, is happy to contribute her spiritual life, her cultural heritage, and the human ideals which she has always served. With generous and loyal devotion, of which We most willingly reassure your Majesty, Our Catholic sons of Iran have placed themselves wholeheartedly in the service of the noblest causes, most notably the instruction and education of youth, the care of the sick, and various charitable ventures. We are pleased to learn that your Majesty, who has always been benevolent toward Christian institutions, has recently taken an interest in the foundation of new hospitals and scientific institutions which, We are sure, will be developed for the greater good of all. It is God's wish that such a spirit of peaceful cooperation, so much in conformity with the traditions of the Church and with the native qualities of your people, should continue to bear the best fruits on the earth of Iran.

But this year the influenza, or as you so often call it, the « flu », has found its way even into the Vatican here in Rome, and We, like so many of you, have had to stay in bed for a while in order to get well and strong again. That is why the doctors say that this year We should not speak to you over the radio. But at least We wanted to send you this short letter. You children of America have been so good and generous these past few years in giving your gifts to help your brothers and sisters in the lands across the sea! We know that our dear Lord has blessed you for this many times over, because He acts just as if you gave your gifts of clothes or food or money to Him. « Whatever you do to one of these little ones », He said, « you do to Me ». And of course nobody can ever « get ahead » of Our Lord in giving. So He certainly blesses you much more in return, for He gives you the love and kindness of your dear Mother and Father, of your brothers and sisters, of your good teachers; He gives you your grand Catholic education and, best and most wonderful of all, He gives you Himself, when He comes into your heart in Holy Communion. No, Our Lord never forgets a favor done to one of these « little ones » of His across the sea. And this year too they need your help again. Too many of them still are hungry and cold and homeless. Too many still need medicines, and vitamins and milk. Too many, just your age, have to wear clothes that do not protect their little bodies from the wind and the rain and the cold. And now just lately, because of the terrible floods in Holland and England and Belgium, many more thousands of children have lost their homes and everything they once had. So your clothes, and coins, and canned goods, and whatever else you can give, as your teachers will explain to you, will mean so much to them. Do not say, « But my offering is so little. What is this for so many poor children? ». Remember, each one of you perhaps can give only a little. But there are many thousands of you, and when everything is collected and put together, it makes a great deal, just as the mighty ocean is made of many drops of water, though each one of them is very tiny. So We know you will be generous, dear children, with your gifts, and still more with your prayers and sacrifices. For the most important thing of all, even more important than keeping your poor little friends warm and healthy and well-fed, is to keep them good and free from sin. So you must pray hard that their misfortune does not make them bad, or lead them in their trouble to forget our dear Lord. Perhaps you can say at least one extra Hail Mary every day during Lent that Our Lady, their Mother as well as yours, guide them and keep them safe from sin. Offer your little acts of sacrifice for them. Try to be especially good and obedient during Lent for them. Receive Our Lord often in Holy Communion, and when you have Our Lord in your heart and are praying to Him for your Mother and Father and your brothers and Sisters, remind Him too of these other children of His who need His help so much. Pray too for Us, who here in Vatican City from a Father's heart send you and all your dear ones a Father's blessing.","pope":"Pius XII","type":"Message","year":1953}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610a4e46677c250714c80375"},"text":"Health, Venerable Brethren, and the Apostolic Blessing. The concern and sorrow which We feel at the present sad plight of human society at large in no way lessen Our special solicitude for Our beloved sons of the Mexican nation and for you, Venerable Brethren, who are the more deserving of Our paternal regard because you have been so long harassed by grievous persecutions. 2. From the beginning of Our Pontificate, following the example of Our Venerable Predecessor, We endeavoured with all Our might to ward off the application of those constitutional statutes which the Holy See had several times been obliged to condemn as seriously derogatory to the most elementary and inalienable rights of the Church and of the faithful. With this intent We provided that Our Representative should take up his residence in your Republic. 3. But whereas other Governments in recent times have been eager to renew agreements with the Holy See, that of Mexico frustrated every attempt to arrive at an understanding. On the contrary, it most unexpectedly broke the promises made to Us shortly before in writing, banishing repeatedly Our Representatives and showing thereby its animosity against the Church. Thus a most rigorous application was given to Article 130 of the Constitution, against which, on account of its extreme hostility to the Church, as may be seen from Our Encyclical Iniquis afflictisque of November 18, 1926, the Holy See had to protest in the most solemn manner. Heavy penalties were then enacted against the transgressors of this deplorable article; and, as a fresh affront to the Hierarchy of the Church, it was provided that every State of the Confederation should determine the number of priests empowered to exercise the sacred ministry, in public or in private. 4. In view of these unjust and intolerant injunctions, which would have subjected the Church in Mexico to the despotism of the State and of the Government hostile to the Catholic religion, you determined, Venerable Brethren, to suspend public worship, and at the same time called on the faithful to make efficacious protest against the unjust procedure of the Government. For your apostolic firmness, you were nearly all exiled from the Republic, and from the land of your banishment you had to witness the struggles and martyrdom of your priests and of your flock; whilst those very few amongst you who almost by miracle were able to remain in hiding in their own dioceses succeeded in effectively encouraging the faithful with the splendid example of their own undaunted spirit. Of these events We took occasion to speak in solemn allocutions, in public discourses, and more at length in the above-mentioned Encyclical Iniquis afflictisque, and We were comforted by the world's admiration for the courage displayed by the clergy in administering the Sacraments to the faithful, amid a thousand dangers and at the risk of their lives, and for the like heroism of many of the faithful, who at the cost of unheard-of sufferings and enormous sacrifices, gave valiant assistance to their priests. 5. Meanwhile We did not forbear to encourage with word and counsel the lawful Christian resistance of the priests and the faithful, exhorting them to placate by penance and prayer God's Justice, that in His merciful Providence He might shorten the time of trial. At the same time We invited Our sons throughout the world to unite their prayers to Ours in behalf of their brethren in Mexico; and wonderful were the ardour and whole-heartedness with which they responded to Our appeal. Nor did We neglect to have recourse besides to the human means at Our disposal, in order to give assistance to Our beloved sons. Whilst addressing Our appeal to the Catholic world to give help, and generous alms, to their persecuted Mexican brethren, We urged the Governments with whom We have diplomatic relations to take to heart the abnormal and grievous condition of so many of the faithful. 6. In the face of the firm and generous resistance of the oppressed, the Government now began to give indications in various ways that it would not be averse to coming to an agreement, if only to put an end to a condition of affairs which it could not turn to its own advantage. Whereupon, though taught by painful experiences to put scant trust in such promises, We felt obliged to ask Ourselves whether it was for the good of souls to prolong the suspension of public worship. That suspension had indeed been an effective protest against the arbitrary interference of the Government; nevertheless, its continuation might have seriously prejudiced civil and religious order. Of even greater weight was the consideration that this suspension, according to grave reports which We received from various and unexceptionable sources, was productive of serious harm to the faithful. As these were bereft of spiritual helps necessary for the Christian life, and not infrequently were obliged to omit their religious duties, they ran the risk of first remaining apart from and then of being entirely separated from the priesthood, and in consequence from the very sources of supernatural life. To this must be added the fact that the prolonged absence of almost all the Bishops from their dioceses could not fail to bring about a relaxation of ecclesiastical discipline, especially in times of such great tribulation for the Mexican Church, when clergy and people had particular need of the guidance of those \"whom the Holy Ghost has placed to rule the Church of God.\" 7. When, therefore, in 1929 the Supreme Magistrate of Mexico publicly declared that the Government, by applying the laws in question, had no intention of destroying the \"identity of the Church\" or of ignoring the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, We thought it best, having no other intention but the good of souls, to profit by the occasion, which seemed to offer a possibility of having the rights of the Hierarchy duly recognized. Seeing, therefore, some hope of remedying greater evils, and judging that the principal motives that had induced the Episcopate to suspend public worship no longer existed, We asked Ourselves whether it were not advisable to order its resumption. In this there was certainly no intention of accepting the Mexican regulations of worship, nor of withdrawing Our protests against these regulations, much less of ceasing to combat them. It was merely a question of abandoning, in view of the Government's new declarations, one of the methods of resistance, before it could bring harm to the faithful, and of having recourse instead to others deemed more opportune. 8. Unfortunately, as all know, Our wishes and desires were not followed by the peace and favourable settlement for which We had hoped. On the contrary, to Bishops, priests, and faithful Catholics continued to be penalized and imprisoned, contrary to the spirit in which the modus vivendihad been established. To Our great distress We saw that not merely were all the Bishops not recalled from exile, but that others were expelled without even the semblance of legality. In several dioceses neither churches nor seminaries, Bishops' residences, nor other sacred edifices, were restored; notwithstanding explicit promises, priests and laymen who had steadfastly defended the faith were abandoned to the cruel vengeance of their adversaries. Furthermore, as soon as the suspension of public worship had been revoked, increased violence was noticed in the campaign of the press against the clergy, the Church, and God Himself; and it is well known that the Holy See had to condemn one of these publications, which in its sacrilegious immorality and acknowledged purpose of anti-religious and slanderous propaganda had exceeded all bounds. 9. Add to this that not only is religious instruction forbidden in the primary schools, but not infrequently attempts are made to induce those whose duty it is to educate the future generations, to become purveyors of irreligious and immoral teachings, thus obliging the parents to make heavy sacrifices in order to safeguard the innocence of their children. We bless with all Our heart these Christian parents and all the good teachers who help them, and We urge upon you, Venerable Brethren, upon the clergy secular and regular, and upon all the faithful, the necessity of giving their utmost attention to the question of education and the formation of the young, especially among the poorer classes, since they are more exposed to atheist, masonic, and communistic propaganda, persuading yourselves that your country will be such as you build it up in the children. 10. An effort has been made to strike the Church in a still more vital spot; namely, in the existence of the clergy and the Catholic hierarchy, by trying to eliminate it gradually from the Republic. Thus the Mexican Constitution, as We have several times deplored, while proclaiming liberty of thought and conscience, prescribes with the most evident contradiction that each State of the Federal Republic must determine the number of priests to whom the exercise of the sacred ministry is allowed, not only in public churches, but even within private dwellings. This enormity is further aggravated by the way in which the law is applied. The Constitution lays down that the number of priests must be determined, but ordains that this determination must correspond to the religious needs of the faithful and of the locality. It does not prescribe that the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy is to be ignored in this matter, and this point was explicitly recognized in the declarations of the modus vivendi. Now in the State of Michoacan one priest was assigned for every 33,000 of the faithful, in the State of Chiapas one for every 60,000, while in the State of Vera Cruz only one priest was assigned to exercise the sacred ministry for every 100,000 of the inhabitants. Everyone can see whether it is possible with such restrictions to administer the Sacraments to so many people, scattered for the most part over a vast territory. Indeed, the persecutors, as though sorry for having been too liberal and indulgent, have imposed further limitations. Some Governors closed seminaries, confiscated canonries, and determined the sacred buildings and the territory to which the ministry of the approved priest would be restricted. 11. The clearest manifestation of the will to destroy the Catholic Church itself is, however, the explicit declaration, published in some States, that the civil Authority, in granting the licence for priestly ministry, recognizes no Hierarchy; on the contrary, it positively excludes from the possibility of exercising the sacred ministry all of hierarchic rank - namely, all Bishops and even those who have held the office of Apostolic Delegates. 12. We wished briefly to rehearse the salient points in the grievous condition of the Church in Mexico, so that all lovers of order and peace among nations, on seeing that such an unheard of persecution differs but little, especially in certain States, from the one raging within the unhappy borders of Russia, may from this iniquitous similarity of purpose conceive fresh ardour to stem the torrent which is subverting all social order. At the same time it is Our intention to give a new proof to you, Venerable Brethren, and to all Our beloved sons of Mexico, of the paternal solicitude with which We follow you in your tribulation: the same solicitude that inspired the instructions which We gave you last January through Our Beloved Son the Cardinal Secretary of State, and which was communicated to you by Our Apostolic Delegate. In matters strictly connected with religion, it is undoubtedly Our duty and Our right to establish the reasons and norms that all who glory in the name of Catholics are under the obligation of obeying. In this connection We are anxious to recall to mind that when We issued these instructions We gave due consideration to all the reports and advices that came to Us either from the Hierarchy or the faithful. We say all, even those that appeared to counsel a return to a severer line of conduct, with the total suspension of public worship throughout the Republic, as in 1926. 13. Concerning, therefore the conduct to follow, since the number of priests is not equally limited in every State, nor the rights of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy everywhere equally disregarded, it is evident that, according to the different application of the unhappy decrees, different likewise must be the conduct of the Church and the Catholics. Here it seems just to pay a special tribute of praise to those Mexican Bishops who, according to advices received, have wisely interpreted the instructions We have inculcated time and again. To this We wish to call attention; for if some persons, urged rather by zeal for the defence of their own faith than by the prudence so necessary in delicate situations, may from diverse conduct in diverse circumstances have imagined contradictory judgments on the part of the Bishops, let them now be certain that such an accusation is utterly unfounded. Nevertheless, since any restriction whatever of the number of priests is a grave violation of divine rights, it will be necessary for the Bishops, the clergy, and the Catholic laity to continue to protest with all their energy against such violation, using every legitimate means. For even if these protests have no effect on those who govern the country, they will be effective in persuading the faithful, especially the uneducated, that by such action the State attacks the liberty of the Church, which liberty the Church can never renounce, no matter what may be the violence of the persecutors. 14. And therefore, just as We have read with satisfaction the protests recently made by the Bishops and priests of the diocese that are victims of the deplorable measures of the Government, so We join Our protests to yours before the whole world, and in a special manner before the Rulers of the Nations, to make them realize that the persecution of Mexico, besides being an outrage against God, against His Church, and against the conscience of a Catholic people, is also an incentive to the subversion of the social order, which is the aim of those organizations professing to deny God. 15. Meanwhile, in order to remedy to some extent the calamitous conditions that afflict the Church in Mexico, We must avail ourselves of those means which We still have in hand, so that, by the maintenance of divine worship as far as possible in every place, the light of faith and the sacred fire of charity may not be extinguished among those unhappy populations. Certainly, the laws are iniquitous that are impious, as We have already said, and condemned by God for everything that they iniquitously and impiously derogate from the rights of God and of the Church in the government of souls. Nevertheless, it would be a vain and unfounded fear to think that one is cooperating with these iniquitous legislative ordinances which oppress him, were he to ask the Government which imposes these things for permission to carry out public worship, and hence to hold that it is one's duty to refrain absolutely from making such a request. Such an erroneous opinion and conduct might lead to a total suspension of public worship, and would, without doubt, inflict grievous harm on the entire flock of the faithful. 16. It is well to observe that to approve such an iniquitous law, or spontaneously to give to it true and proper cooperation, is undoubtedly illicit and sacrilegious. but absolutely different is the case of one who yields to such unjust regulations solely against his will and under protest, and who besides does everything he can to lessen the disastrous effects of the pernicious law. In fact, the priest finds himself compelled to ask for that permission without which it would be impossible for him to exercise his sacred ministry for the good of souls; it is an imposition to which he is forced to submit in order to avoid a greater evil. His behaviour, consequently, is not very different from that of one who having been robbed of his belongings is obliged to ask his unjust despoiler for at least the use of them. 17. In truth, the danger of formal cooperation, or of any approval whatever of the present law, is removed, as far as is necessary, by the protests energetically expressed by this Apostolic See, by the whole Episcopate and the people of Mexico. To these are added the precautions of the priest himself, who, although already appointed to the sacred ministry by his own Bishop, is obliged to ask the Government for the possibility of holding divine service; and, far from approving the law that unjustly imposes such a request, submits to it materially, as the saying is, and only in order to remove an obstacle to the exercise of the sacred ministry: an obstacle that would lead, as We have said, to a total cessation of worship, and hence to exceedingly great harm to innumerable souls. In much the same manner the faithful and the sacred ministers of the early Church, as history relates, sought permission, by means of gifts even, to visit and comfort the martyrs detained in prison and to administer the Sacraments to them; yet surely no one could have thought that by so doing they in some way approved or justified the conduct of the persecutors. 18. Such is the certain and safe doctrine of the Church. If, however, the putting of it into practice should cause scandal to some of the faithful, it will be your duty, Venerable Brethren, to enlighten them carefully and exactly. If, after you have performed this office of explanation and persuasion, according to these Our directions, anyone should cling stubbornly to his own false opinion, let him know that he can hardly escape the reproach of disobedience and obstinacy. 19. Let all, then, continue in that unity of purpose and obedience that We have praised in the clergy, on another occasion, at length and with lively satisfaction. And, putting aside all uncertainties and fears easily understood in the first moments of the persecution, let the priests with their proved spirit of abnegation render ever more intense their sacred ministry, particularly among the young and the common people, striving to carry on a work of persuasion and of charity especially among the enemies of the Church, who combat her because they do not know her. 20. And here We recommend anew a point that We have greatly at heart, namely, the necessity of instituting and furthering to an ever greater extent Catholic Action, according to the directions communicated at Our command by Our Apostolic Delegate. This is undoubtedly a difficult undertaking in its first stages, and especially in the present circumstances - an undertaking slow at times in producing the desired effects, but necessary and much more efficacious than any other means, as is abundantly proved by the experience of every nation that has been tried in the crucible of religious persecution. 21. To Our beloved Mexican sons We recommend with all Our heart the closest union with the Church and the Hierarchy, manifesting it by their docility to her teachings and directions. Let them not neglect to have recourse to the Sacraments, sources of grace and strength; let them instruct themselves in the truths of religion; let them implore mercy from God on their unhappy nation, and let them make it both a duty and an honour to cooperate with the apostolate of the priesthood in the ranks of Catholic Action. 22. We wish to pay a special tribute of praise to those members of the clergy, secular and regular, and of the Catholic laity, who, moved by burning zeal for religion and maintaining themselves in close obedience to this Apostolic See, have written glorious pages in the recent history of the Church in Mexico. At the same time We exhort them earnestly in the Lord to continue to defend the sacred rights of the Church with that generous abnegation of which they have given such a splendid example, always following the norms laid down by this Apostolic See. 23. We cannot conclude without turning in a very special manner to you, Venerable Brethren, who are the faithful interpreters of Our thoughts. We wish to tell you that We feel all the more closely united to you, in proportion to the hardships you are meeting with in your apostolic ministry. We are certain that, being so close to the heart of the Vicar of Christ, you will draw comfort and strength from this knowledge to persevere in the holy and arduous enterprise of leading to salvation the flock entrusted to you. And that the grace of God may ever assist you and His Mercy support you, with all paternal affection, We impart to you and to Our beloved sons so sorely tried, the Apostolic Benediction. Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, on the feast of the Dedication of Saint Michael the Archangel, the twenty-ninth day of September in the year 1932, the eleventh of Our Pontificate.","pope":"Pius XI","type":"Encyclical","year":1932}

And thinking with unspeakable regret of our young sons, who were being mown down by death in thousands, We opened Our heart, enlarged by the charity of Christ, to all the crushing sorrow of the mothers, and of the wives made widows before their time, and to all the inconsolable laments of the little ones, too early bereft of a father's care. Sharing in the anxious fears of innumerable families, and fully conscious of the imperative duties imposed upon Us by the sublime mission of peace and of love, entrusted to Our care in days of so much sadness, We conceived at once the firm purpose of consecrating all Our energy and all Our power to the reconciling of the peoples at war : indeed, We made it a solemn promise to Our Divine Saviour, Who willed to make all men brothers at the cost of His Blood. And Our first words, as the Chief Shepherd of souls, addressed to the Nations and their Rulers, were words of peace and of love. But Our advice, affectionate and insistent as that of a father and a friend, remained unheard. Our grief was aggravated, but Our purpose was unshaken ; We turned, therefore, in all confidence to the Almighty, Who holds in His Hands the minds and hearts of subjects, as of Kings, begging of Him the cessation of the unprecedented scourge. We wished to associate all the faithful in Our fervent and humble prayer, and to make it the more efficacious, We arranged that it should be accompanied by works of christian penance. But to-day, on the anniversary of the outbreak of the tremendous conflict, more intense is the desire of Our heart for the speedy conclusion of the war, still louder; is Our fatherly cry for peace. May this cry, prevailing over the dreadful clash of arms, reach unto the peoples who are now at war, and unto their Rulers, inclining both to milder and more serene views. In the holy name of God, in the name of our heavenly Father and Lord, by the Blessed Blood of Jesus, price of man's redemption, We conjure You, whom Divine Providence has placed over the Nations at war, to put an end at last to this horrible slaughter, which for a whole year has dishonoured Europe. It is the blood of brothers that is being poured out on land and sea. The most beautiful regions of Europe, this garden of the world, are sown with corpses and with ruin: there, where but a short time ago flourished the industry of manufactures and the fruitful labour of the fields, now thunders fearfully the cannon, and in its destructive fury it spares neither village nor city, but spreads everywhere havoc and death. You bear before God and man the tremendous responsibility of peace and war ; give ear to Our prayer, to the fatherly voice of the Vicar of the Eternal and Supreme Judge, to Whom you must render an account as well of your public undertakings, as of your own individual deeds. The abounding wealth, with which God the Creator has enriched the lands that are subject to You, allow You to go on with the struggle; but at what cost? Let the thousands of young lives quenched every day on the fields of battle make answer : answer, the ruins of so many towns and villages, of so many monuments raised by the piety and genius of your ancestors. And the bitter tears shed in the secrecy of home, or at the foot of altars where suppliants beseech, do not these also repeat that the price of the long drawn-out struggle is great, too great? Nor let it be said that the immense conflict cannot be settled without the violence of war. Lay aside your mutual purpose of destruction; remember that Nations do not die ; humbled and oppressed, they chafe under the yoke imposed upon them, preparing a renewal of the combat, and passing down from generation to generation a mournful heritage of hatred and revenge. Why not from this moment weigh with serene mind the rights and lawful aspirations of the peoples? Why not initiate with a good will an exchange of views, directly or indirectly, with the object of holding in due account, within the limits of possibility, those rights and aspirations, and thus succeed in putting an end to the monstrous struggle, as has been done under other similar circumstances? Blessed be he who will first raise the olive-branch, and hold out his right hand to the enemy with an offer of reasonable terms of peace. The equilibrium of the world, and the prosperity and assured tranquillity of Nations rest upon mutual benevolence and respect for the rights and the dignity of others, much more than upon hosts of armed men and the ring of formidable fortresses. This is the cry of peace which breaks forth from Our heart with added vehemence on this mournful day; and We invite all, whosoever are the friends of peace the world over, to give Us a helping hand in order to hasten the termination of the war, which for a long year has changed Europe into one vast battlefield. May the merciful Jesus, through the intercession of His Sorrowful Mother, grant that at last, after so horrible a storm, the dawn of peace may break, placid and radiant, an image of His own Divine Countenance. May hymns of thanksgiving soon rise to the Most High, the Giver of all good things, for the accomplished reconciliation of the States; may the peoples, bound in bonds of brotherly love, return to the peaceful rivalry of studies, of arts, of industries, and, with the empire of right reestablished, may they resolve from now henceforth to entrust the settlement of their differences, not to the sword's edge, but to reasons of equity and justice, pondered with due cairn and deliberation. This will be their most splendid and glorious conquest! In loving trust that the tree of peace may soon return to rejoice the world with such desirable fruits, We impart the Apostolic Benediction to all who make up the mystical flock confided to Us, and also for those, who do not yet belong to the Church of Rome, We pray the Lord to draw them close to Us in the bonds of perfect charity.","pope":"Benedict XV","type":"Apostolic Exhortation","year":1915}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610a5034677c250714c80377"},"text":"Venerable Brethren, Health and the Apostolic Benediction. In addressing you for the first time from the Chair of the supreme apostolate to which We have, by the inscrutable disposition of God, been elevated, it is not necessary to remind you with what tears and warm instance We exerted Ourselves to ward off this formidable burden of the Pontificate. Unequal in merit though We be with St. Anselm, it seems to us that We may with truth make Our own the words in which he lamented when he was constrained against his will and in spite of his struggles to receive the honor of the episcopate. For to show with what dispositions of mind and will We subjected Ourselves to the most serious charge of feeding the flock of Christ, We can well adduce those same proofs of grief which he invokes in his own behalf. \"My tears are witnesses,\" he wrote, \"and the sounds and moanings issuing from the anguish of my heart, such as I never remember before to have come from me for any sorrow, before that day on which there seemed to fall upon me that great misfortune of the archbishop of Canterbury. And those who fixed their gaze on my face that day could not fail to see it . . . I, in color more like a dead than a living man, was pale for amazement and alarm. Hitherto I have resisted as far as I could, speaking the truth, my election or rather the violence done me. But now I am constrained to confess, whether I will or no, that the judgments of God oppose greater and greater resistance to my efforts, so that I see no way of escaping them. Wherefore vanquished as I am by the violence not so much of men as of God, against which there is no providing, I realize that nothing is left for me, after having prayed as much as I could and striven that this chalice should if possible pass from me without my drinking it, but to set aside my feeling and my will and resign myself entirely to the design and the will of God.\" 2. In truth reasons both numerous and most weighty were not lacking to justify this resistance of Ours. For, beside the fact that We deemed Ourselves altogether unworthy through Our littleness of the honor of the Pontificate; who would not have been disturbed at seeing himself designated to succeed him who, ruling the Church with supreme wisdom for nearly twenty six years, showed himself adorned with such sublimity of mind, such luster of every virtue, as to attract to himself the admiration even of adversaries, and to leave his memory stamped in glorious achievements? 3. Then again, to omit other motives, We were terrified beyond all else by the disastrous state of human society today. For who can fail to see that society is at the present time, more than in any past age, suffering from a terrible and deeprooted malady which, developing every day and eating into its inmost being, is dragging it to destruction? You understand, Venerable Brethren, what this disease is - apostasy from God, than which in truth nothing is more allied with ruin, according to the word of the Prophet: \"For behold they that go far from Thee shall perish\" (Ps. 1xxii., 17). We saw therefore that, in virtue of the ministry of the Pontificate, which was to be entrusted to Us, We must hasten to find a remedy for this great evil, considering as addressed to Us that Divine command: \"Lo, I have set thee this day over the nations and over kingdoms, to root up, and to pull down, and to waste, and to destroy, and to build, and to plant\" (Jerem. i., 10). But, cognizant of Our weakness, We recoiled in terror from a task as urgent as it is arduous. 4. Since, however, it has been pleasing to the Divine Will to raise Our lowliness to such sublimity of power, We take courage in Him who strengthens Us; and setting Ourselves to work, relying on the power of God, We proclaim that We have no other program in the Supreme Pontificate but that \"of restoring all things in Christ\" (Ephes. i., 10), so that \"Christ may be all and in all\" (Coloss. iii, 2). Some will certainly be found who, measuring Divine things by human standards will seek to discover secret aims of Ours, distorting them to an earthly scope and to partisan designs. To eliminate all vain delusions for such, We say to them with emphasis that We do not wish to be, and with the Divine assistance never shall be aught before human society but the Minister of God, of whose authority We are the depositary. The interests of God shall be Our interest, and for these We are resolved to spend all Our strength and Our very life. Hence, should anyone ask Us for a symbol as the expression of Our will, We will give this and no other: \"To renew all things in Christ.\" In undertaking this glorious task, We are greatly quickened by the certainty that We shall have all of you, Venerable Brethren, as generous cooperators. Did We doubt it We should have to regard you, unjustly, as either unconscious or heedless of that sacrilegious war which is now, almost everywhere, stirred up and fomented against God. For in truth, \"The nations have raged and the peoples imagined vain things\" (Ps.ii., 1.) against their Creator, so frequent is the cry of the enemies of God: \"Depart from us\" (Job. xxi., 14). And as might be expected we find extinguished among the majority of men all respect for the Eternal God, and no regard paid in the manifestations of public and private life to the Supreme Will - nay, every effort and every artifice is used to destroy utterly the memory and the knowledge of God. 5. When all this is considered there is good reason to fear lest this great perversity may be as it were a foretaste, and perhaps the beginning of those evils which are reserved for the last days; and that there may be already in the world the \"Son of Perdition\" of whom the Apostle speaks (II. Thess. ii., 3). Such, in truth, is the audacity and the wrath employed everywhere in persecuting religion, in combating the dogmas of the faith, in brazen effort to uproot and destroy all relations between man and the Divinity! While, on the other hand, and this according to the same apostle is the distinguishing mark of Antichrist, man has with infinite temerity put himself in the place of God, raising himself above all that is called God; in such wise that although he cannot utterly extinguish in himself all knowledge of God, he has contemned God's majesty and, as it were, made of the universe a temple wherein he himself is to be adored. \"He sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself as if he were God\" (II. Thess. ii., 2). 6. Verily no one of sound mind can doubt the issue of this contest between man and the Most High. Man, abusing his liberty, can violate the right and the majesty of the Creator of the Universe; but the victory will ever be with God - nay, defeat is at hand at the moment when man, under the delusion of his triumph, rises up with most audacity. Of this we are assured in the holy books by God Himself. Unmindful, as it were, of His strength and greatness, He \"overlooks the sins of men\" (Wisd. xi., 24), but swiftly, after these apparent retreats, \"awaked like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine\" (Ps. 1xxvii., 65), \"He shall break the heads of his enemies\" (Ps. 1xxvii., 22), that all may know \"that God is the king of all the earth\" (Ib. 1xvi, 8), \"that the Gentiles may know themselves to be men\"(Ib. ix., 20). 7. All this, Venerable Brethren, We believe and expect with unshakable faith. But this does not prevent us also, according to the measure given to each, from exerting ourselves to hasten the work of God - and not merely by praying assiduously: \"Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened\" (Ib. ix., 19), but, more important still, by affirming both by word and deed and in the light of day, God's supreme dominion over man and all things, so that His right to command and His authority may be fully realized and respected. This is imposed upon us not only as a natural duty, but by our common interest. For, Venerable Brethren, who can avoid being appalled and afflicted when he beholds, in the midst of a progress in civilization which is justly extolled, the greater part of mankind fighting among themselves so savagely as to make it seem as though strife were universal? The desire for peace is certainly harbored in every breast, and there is no one who does not ardently invoke it. But to want peace without God is an absurdity, seeing that where God is absent thence too justice flies, and when justice is taken away it is vain to cherish the hope of peace. \"Peace is the work of justice\" (Is. xxii., 17). There are many, We are well aware, who, in their yearning for peace, that is for the tranquillity of order, band themselves into societies and parties, which they style parties of order. Hope and labor lost. For there is but one party of order capable of restoring peace in the midst of all this turmoil, and that is the party of God. It is this party, therefore, that we must advance, and to it attract as many as possible, if we are really urged by the love of peace. 8. But, Venerable Brethren, we shall never, however much we exert ourselves, succeed in calling men back to the majesty and empire of God, except by means of Jesus Christ. \"No one,\" the Apostle admonishes us, \"can lay other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.\" (I. Cor.,iii., II.) It is Christ alone \"whom the Father sanctified and sent into this world\" (Is. x., 36), \"the splendor of the Father and the image of His substance\" (Hebr.i., 3), true God and true man: without whom nobody can know God with the knowledge for salvation, \"neither doth anyone know the Father but the Son, and he to whom it shall please the Son to reveal Him.\" (Matth. xi., 27.) Hence it follows that to restore all things in Christ and to lead men back to submission to God is one and the same aim. To this, then, it behoves Us to devote Our care - to lead back mankind under the dominion of Christ; this done, We shall have brought it.","pope":"Pius X","type":"Encyclical","year":1903}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610a5154677c250714c80378"},"text":"To Our Venerable Brethren, the Archbishops, and Bishops of Scotland. Venerable Brethren, Health and Apostolic Blessing. The ardent charity which renders Us solicitous of Our separated brethren, in nowise permits Us to cease Our efforts to bring back to the embrace of the GoodShepherd those whom manifold error causes to stand aloof from the one Fold ofChrist. Day after day We deplore more deeply the unhappy lot of those who aredeprived of the fullness of the Christian Faith. Wherefore moved by the sense ofthe responsibility which Our most sacred office entails, and by the spirit andgrace of the most loving Saviour of men, Whom We unworthily represent, We areconstantly imploring them to agree at last to restore together with Us thecommunion of the one and the same faith. A momentous work, and of all humanworks the most difficult to be accomplished; one which God's almighty poweralone can effect. But for this very reason We do not lose heart, nor are Wedeterred from Our purpose by the magnitude of the difficulties which cannot beovercome by human power alone. \"We preach Christ crucified . . . and theweakness of God is stronger than men\" (1 Cor. i. 23-25). In the midstof so many errors and of so many evils with which We are afflicted orthreatened, We continue to point out whence salvation should be sought,exhorting and admonishing all nations to lift up \"their eyes to themountains whence help shall come\" (Ps. cxx.). For indeed that which Isaiasspoke in prophecy has been fulfilled, and the Church of God stands forth soconspicuously by its Divine origin and authority that it can be distinguished byall beholders: \"And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lordshall be prepared on the top of mountains and shall be exalted above thehills\" (Is. ii. 2). 2. Scotland, so dear to the Holy See, and in a special manner to Us, has itsplace in Our care and solicitude. We love to recall the fact that over twentyyears ago the first act of Our Apostolic Ministry was performed in favour ofScotland, for on the second day of our Pontificate We gave back to the Scottishpeople their Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. From that day forward, with yourefficient co-operation, Venerable Brethren, and that of your clergy, We haveconstantly sought to promote the welfare of your nation, which is naturallyinclined to embrace the truth. And now that We are so far advanced in years thatthe end cannot be delayed much longer, We have thought it meet to address you,Venerable Brethren, andthus give your nation a further proof of Our Apostolic affection. 3. The terrible storm which swept over the Church in the sixteenth century,deprived the vast majority of the Scottish people, as well as many other peoplesof Europe, of that Catholic Faith which they had gloriously held for over onethousand years. It is most pleasing to Us to revert to the great achievements ofyour forefathers on behalf of Catholicism, and also to allude to some of those,and they are many, to whose virtue and illustrious deeds Scotland owes so muchof her renown. Surely your fellow-countrymen will not take it ill that We shouldagain remind them of what they owe to the Catholic Church and to the ApostolicSee. We speak of what you already know. As your ancient Annals relate, St.Ninian, a countryman of yours, was so inflamed with the desire of greaterspiritual progress by the reading of Holy Writ, that he exclaimed: \"I shallrise and go over sea and land, seeking that truth which my soul loveth. But isso much trouble needful? Was it not said to Peter: `Thou are Peter and upon thisrock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail againstit?' Therefore in the faith of Peter there is nothing wanting, nothing obscure,nothing imperfect, nothing against which evil doctrines and pernicious views canprevail, after the manner of the gates of hell. And where is the faith of Peter,but in the See of Peter? Thither, thither I must repair, that going forth frommy country, from my kindred, and from my father's house, I may see in the landof the Vision the will of the Lord and be protected by His Temple.\" (Ex Hist. Vitae S. Niniani a S. Aelredo Ab. cons.) Hence, full of reverence hehastened to Rome, and when at the Tomb of the Apostles he had imbibed inabundance Catholic truth at its very source and fountainhead, by command of theSupreme Pontiff he returned home, preached the true Roman faith to hisfellow-countrymen, and founded the Church of Galloway about two hundred yearsbefore St. Augustine landed in England. This was the faith of St. Columba; thiswas the faith kept so religiously and preached so zealously by the monks of old,whose chief centre, Iona, was rendered famous by their eminent virtues. Need Wemention Queen Margaret, a light and ornament not only of Scotland, but of thewhole of Christendom, who, though she occupied the most exalted position inpoint of worldly dignity,sought only in her whole life things eternal and divine, and thus spread throughout the Church the luster of her virtues? There can be no doubt she owed this her eminent sanctity to the influence and guidance of the Catholic Faith. And did not the power and constancy of the Catholic faith give to Wallace and Bruce, the two great heroes of your race, their indomitable courage in defence of their country? We say nothing of the immense number of those who achieved so much for the commonwealth, and who belong to that progeny which the Catholic Church has never ceased to bring forth. We say nothing of the advantages which your nation has derived from her influence. It is undeniable that it was through her wisdom and authority that those famous seats of learning were opened at St. Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, and that your judicial system was drawn up and adopted. Hence We can well understand why Scotland has been honoured by the title of \"Special Daughter of the Holy See.\" 4. But since then a great change has come to pass, the ancient faith having beenextinguished in the minds of the vast majority of your countrymen. Are we tosuppose that it will never be restored? There are indeed some signs which leadUs to hope that, by the grace of God, a brighter religious future awaits theScotch people. We see that Catholics are more liberally and kindly dealt with astime goes on, that Catholic doctrines are no longer publicly held up to scorn,as perhaps was formerly the case, but on the contrary are favourably consideredby many, and accepted by not a few. We also perceive that false views andopinions, which effectively prevent the perception of truth, are graduallydisappearing. May the search after truth spread more, for there is no doubt thatan accurate knowledge of the Catholic Religion, drawn from its own, and not fromextraneous, sources, will clear away many prejudices. 5. Great praise is due to the Scottish nation, as a whole, that they have always shown reverence and love for the Inspired Writings. They cannot therefore be unwilling to listen to a few words which in Our affection We would address to them on this subject with a view to their eternal welfare; since We find that in revering the Sacred Scriptures, they are in agreement with the Catholic Church. Why then should this not be the starting-point for a return to unity? We beg them to remember that they have the Books of the Old Covenant and of the Newfrom the Catholic Church and from the Catholic Church alone. If these InspiredWritings have passed unscathed through the many and dangerous vicissitudes ofcenturies, such a blessing is to be attributed to her never-failing vigilanceand unceasing care. History attests that in the early ages of the Church theintegrity of the Scriptures was preserved by the ever-memorable efforts of theThird Synod at Carthage and of Innocent I, the Roman Pontiff. At a later time noless watchfulness was shown, as we know, by Eugenius IV and by the Council ofTrent. We Ourselves, not unmindful of the necessities of the present day,published a short while ago an Encyclical Letter in which We gravely addressedthe Bishops of the Catholic world and diligently admonished them as to the meansto be adopted in order to safeguard the integrity and the Divine authority ofthe Sacred Writings. For owing to the restlessness of modern thought, there aremany whom the inordinate desire of superciliously inquiring into everything, andcontempt for antiquity, pervert to such a degree, that they either refuse allauthority to Holy Writ, or at least seriously curtail and minimize it. Thesemen, puffed up by an exaggerated estimate of their own knowledge, and having anoverweening trust in their own judgment, fail to perceive how rash and monstrousit is to try to measure the works of God by our own puny intelligence; nor dothey sufficiently heed St. Augustine's warning: \"Honour God's Scripture,honour God's Word though not understood, reverently wait in order tounderstand\" (in Ps. 146, n. 12). \"Those who study the VenerableScriptures ought to be admonished . . . that they must pray in order tocomprehend.\" (Doct. Chr. lib. iii., c. 37, n. 56.) \"Lest anythingunknown be rashly asserted as known . . . let nothing be rashly asserted, butall things cautiously and modestly examined\" (in Gen. Op. Imp.). 6. But as the Church was to last to the end of time, something more was required besides the bestowal of the Sacred Scriptures. It was obviously necessary that the Divine Founder should take every precaution, lest the treasure of heavenly-given truths, possessed by the Church, should ever be destroyed, which would assuredly have happened, had He left those doctrines to each one's private judgment.","pope":"Leo XIII","type":"Encyclical","year":1898}

With the more assiduous zeal We have striven to raise the afflicted fortunes of the Church of the Armenians and to bring it back to that order, harmony and stability which could restore it to its former dignity, the more bitterly We are troubled by the malice of some who not only make all Our cares vain, but by their intrigues lacerate consciences, scandalize the timid, and succeed in harming their own people. The ever-increasing evils caused by their wiles were recorded in Our Apostolic Letter Non sine gravissimo which We published on the 24th of February this year, and in the meantime, in order to suppress and crush them, We sent to you the Venerable Brother Antonio Giuseppe Archbishop of Tiane as Our Apostolic Delegate. Indeed, today we are afflicted with an even deeper sorrow, because his gentleness, his prudence, his authority have not been able in any way to break or mitigate the audacity of the perverts. He himself, as soon as he arrived at Constantinople, mindful of ecclesiastical gentleness, summoned to himself the most important promoters of the sedition, and tried with fatherly admonitions to bring them to due obedience. Since he had used this device in vain, he presented in public Our Letter in which (mentioning also the extraordinary character of the most recent events) We praised his zeal, confirmed Our constitution Reversurus published on the 12th July 1867 in favour of a correct election of Bishops, tried to recall the secular clergy to the duties of their ministry and admonished the Monks and the Laity not to go beyond the limits fixed for them by the Church; We also clearly demonstrated the emptiness of the requests made by the refractors. On that occasion, the Venerable Brother Anthony Joseph himself threatened ecclesiastical censure to those clergy who refused to submit to legitimate authority within the prescribed days. But then, seeing that these days had passed in vain, he decided to extend the time limit still further, and did not strike the recalcitrants with suspension until he had realised that patience was entirely useless and that it was necessary to prevent by severity the danger of further deception at the expense of the simple people. However, those who had been punished in this way not only did not retreat from their obstinacy, but converted the same punishment into a more heinous crime and a greater scandal for others: they impudently despised the authority and laws of the Church, and continued to publicly practice all the duties of the sacred ministry forbidden to them, even in an even more solemn rite. Above all, we regret that some secular priests who live among the Monks of Constantinople, almost all of whom are Mekhitarists of the Venetian Congregation, and all of the Antonian Monks, have committed this crime, and we regret that those who live in this city of ours have not dissented from this decision. These, in fact, not only opposed the Apostolic visitation in their house recommended by Us (like their brothers in the East), and several times rejected the first and second Visitator elected, but all, without asking permission, evaded Us. Among them, also the Venerable Brother Placidus Kasagian who (consecrated with the title of the Church of Antioch, had governed the whole Congregation), unaware of his duty and of the censures imposed on the Bishops who had deserted the Council without imploring pontifical authorization, turned away in turn. Indeed, the obstinacy of the rebels and the cunning used to stir up the souls make more precious and gratifying for Us the firmness of the very many who were induced neither by snares, nor by flattery, nor by threats to abandon the obedience due to Our legitimate authority. Among these, we deem it our duty to praise by name the Mekhitarists of the Viennese Congregation who, unmoved by the deplorable defection of others, remained steadfast in their duty. Indeed, such devout perseverance at such a grave moment gives us the reasonable hope that you, Beloved Sons, having removed all human respect, will strictly follow the noble traces of your fathers who, putting their faith before these defections, bravely endured exile and every adversity rather than loosen their bonds of solidarity with this centre of Catholic unity, or fail in their veneration for which the documents indicated the rules proposed by your school of truth.

Since You earnestly desire that such a salutary work may succeed and flourish daily, You have begged Us to enrich that sacrament with the same sacred indulgences which We granted for a similar work to the Diocese of Malines. We therefore, Venerable Brother, finding nothing better and more agreeable than to lead the wanderers back to the path of salvation, have decided to comply with your wishes with a glad and solicitous heart. We therefore entrust this matter to you, who are particularly dedicated to the good of your flock, and we therefore grant you the power to grant, in Our name and with Our authority, those indulgences which we enumerate here in relation to your riches and which will last until they are revoked by you or your successors in the manner you deem most pleasing to the Lord. The indulgences that you will be able to grant to the faithful of both sexes who have hitherto dedicated themselves or will in the future dedicate themselves to this work are as follows: Plenary indulgence to be gained every year on 16 June, the feast day of St Francis the King, patron saint of that work, provided they have done penance according to the rite of sacramental confession, have renewed themselves with Holy Communion and have prayed to God for the needs of the Catholic Church and for the increase of that work. Plenary indulgence in articulo morti provided they have both the aforementioned sacraments or (when they cannot have access to them) are at least contrite, have invoked the most holy name of Jesus with their mouths or, not being able to do so with their mouths, with a feeling of devotion. An indulgence of ten years to be gained in individual rounds, each time they meet to discuss matters concerning the same work and recite the prayer that is read at the proper Mass. Another ten years of indulgence each time they have induced the same concubinaries to abandon the way of sin, have taught them the precepts of Our most holy Religion, and have prepared them to receive the sacrament of marriage. Another ten years, likewise, if they will be present while contracting marriage before the Church those who had previously lived in concubinage; finally, another ten years, likewise, if they will receive from the sacred source the concubinaries not yet baptized or their children.

{"_id":{"$oid":"610a554c677c250714c8037b"},"text":"To the subjects of the Papal State involved in the internal uprisings. Gregory XVI to his beloved subjects. Called by Divine Providence, in spite of Our meagreness, to the Supreme Pontificate and to the government of those States that make up its patrimony, We solicitously open Our heart to them, so that they may immediately learn what feelings We were animated by for them from the moment in which the will of He in whose hands the destinies of men are unfolded upon Us. Being for them, rather than a prince, a most loving father, We took on the heart of a father who aspires only to the good of his children, and for them alone does he direct his attention. We immediately turned Our thoughts to the various classes of those whom God gave Us for children, and in the bitterness of Our spirit We saw the unhappy result of those circumstances which in so many ways brought everywhere destitution and disorder. Our glorious Predecessors of ever dear memory, providentially hastened and put into action all the means that the vastness of their vision and their paternal tenderness for the people could suggest to their beneficent minds. However, we are convinced that further provisions are still necessary for the relief of their subjects. We have occupied ourselves with them, and will occupy ourselves unceasingly, although the manifold cares to which the government of the Church calls us, form in Our mind a complex of many other and much more serious thoughts. God knows that in the narrowness of Our resources and in the multitude of inauspicious events, which exhaust them even more, We propose to carry out everything, so that not only by the blessings of heaven, but also by the riches of the earth, may those whom God has entrusted to Us live joyfully in the shade of peace and in the greatest tranquillity. These are the ideas which We have already manifested, these are the instructions which We have issued, these are the measures which We have recommended to those who are to carry out the tasks for which they are responsible, so that all - especially those whom Providence has placed in a state of destitution - may experience how solicitously their new Father watches to reduce their needs as far as possible. But just when We were occupied with the sweet thought of consoling Our children, when We were determining the means of hastening the realization of this, there came to Us very sad announcements of dreadful upheavals in some provinces of Our States. Trusting, however, in that help which brings firmness amidst distress, We humbled Ourselves under the mighty hand of the Lord, considering that the first moments of Our Pontificate were so inauspiciously marked, indeed the very day set aside to honour in Our misery, with solemnity of august ceremonies, the dignity of the Prince of the Apostles, which even in the unworthy heir is not lacking. But in such agitation We are comforted by the thought that the divine Father, who vivifies and mortifies with those counsels that are inscrutable in the short sight of men, knows also with loving traits of His mercy to raise His servants from the depths into which He first reduced them, not allowing the tribulations to be greater than their strength. It is with these sentiments that We speak also to those who, though they unwisely departed from Our bosom, yet did not cease, nor do they cease to be dear to those who retain for them a spirit of charity and mercy. Assured are We, that the knowledge that they have already regained a father to make up for the absence of the one they mourned for, made less monstrous to them the misguidance to which they gave themselves up, we address to them assurances of pity and forgiveness, such as are appropriate to those who know that they are the vicars of a God made man, who gloried as if it were his special prerogative to be meek and humble of heart. Let those unfortunates reflect what wound they have opened in the bosom of their tender father, what peace of mind they have lost, what dangers they have encountered, and in the angry comparison of the state of disorder and restlessness into which they are thrown, let them weep in the sincerity of their hearts that they have turned away from the living waters to form dissipated cisterns. Having only peaceful and conciliatory desires, and seeking only the good of those whom we shall always have for our children, let us now open to them the bowels of loving-kindness, meekness and indulgence, and be too bitter at the mere thought that we may find ourselves in need of recourse to measures of severity, while on the contrary we are resolved to extend to those places, as to the rest of Our dominions, provisions of beneficence and prosperity. May the Father of mercies hear the humble prayers of Us who, having been made mediators between Him and the people, raise fervently, so that, every error having been dispelled, every adverse plot having been vanquished, love of religion, submission, concord may form that spirit which animates all Our subjects, just as that of making them happy is the vow which guides Us in the outpouring of the heart, with which, imparting to all the Apostolic Blessing on all, We implore the fullness of grace for the good of the people.","pope":"Gregory XVI","type":"Epistola","year":1831}

Since, therefore, it has been reported to Us that it is particularly opportune, for the smoother and more expeditious conduct of religious activities in the territory of Cape-Breton in North America, and for the easier spread of the Catholic Faith there, to separate the said territory from the Diocese of Quebec and to submit it to the jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic of Nova Scotia, which is very near to the said territory, We, with the advice of Our Venerable Brother Cardinals of Holy Roman Church in charge of the affairs of Propaganda Fide, have approved this separation. 3.

In this, Our beloved city, many institutions have been providentially founded by the supreme Pontiffs which work effectively for the good and salvation of the Christian people. Among these, the Roman College certainly stands out: built for education and the good arts, thanks to the generosity of Pope Gregory XIII, of happy memory, with great and most generous commitment, it has always been a sign of continuous solicitude and paternal affection on the part of Our Predecessors in every age. It is truly marvellous, and worthy of the most honourable celebration for the College itself, to recall what fruits of virtue and reputation have matured in continuity up to the present day from that hortus conclusus: that is, the illustrious men who for the sanctity of their customs, for the splendour of their dignity, renowned for their learning, have shone from that place of good works, both in the religious field and in the field of public utility. in the field of public utility. This College, which was begun by St Ignatius of Loyola, was entrusted by the Roman Pontiffs to the regular clerics of the Society of Jesus, which he had founded; and it was then commendably run by them while the Society lasted: afterwards it was run by the secular clergy. 2. When then, by the work of Pope Pius VII, of venerable memory, with the apostolic letter of August 7, 1814, the Society of Jesus was restored to its ancient dignity, so that it could particularly resume the work of forming youth in letters and customs, We, who were already aware of the intention of the same Pontiff Pius VII to recall the Society of Jesus to the Roman College, immediately decided to adopt a resolution regarding this problem: After listening to the special Congregation of Our Venerable Brothers the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, to whom We have entrusted the very grave task of reordering the correct formation of youth throughout Our State, after the terrible vicissitudes of the past, We considered that this was the only truly suitable means for the elevation of the human race. 3. Therefore, with full knowledge and with Our mature resolution, in the fullness of Our apostolic authority, We hereby grant, assign and confer on Our beloved sons, the regular clerics of the Society of Jesus, and, on their behalf, on Our beloved son Luigi Forti, General of the Company itself, in perpetuity, the Roman College, with the Church of Saint Ignatius and the adjoining Oratory, known as the Oratory of Father Caravita, as well as the museums, the library, the tower specola, with all the other annexes and appurtenances, on this precise condition: that they reopen the public schools, according to the old custom, as could be seen in 1773; to these schools We order the addition of the chairs of Sacred Eloquence and Chemical Physics. 4. In accordance with the present letter We order them, for the sake of that religion of which they are inflamed, and for that Company to which they gave themselves for the salvation of souls, to devote their work and their activity all the more to teaching children and adolescents religious subjects and the liberal arts, but also to commit themselves to helping them in the care of sacred things in their congregations, and also to assisting the other Christian faithful in the aforesaid Oratory, as was already their custom. 5. We therefore order that they be paid the annual sum of twelve thousand scudi of Roman money, free of all charges; that is, one thousand scudi monthly, beginning next October, to be paid from Our treasury of the tax office in perpetuity; with this sum the food of the members of the Company shall be provided for, the worship and maintenance of the building and of the sacred buildings, and all the necessities of the College. Furthermore, we decree that the rights and privileges of the Roman College remain unchanged, especially those granted by Julius III and Pius IV to confer degrees in the faculties of Arts and Sacred Theology, as well as to guide and consolidate the Congregation of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, called Prima-Primaria. We also order that at appropriate times astronomical observations be printed and other things useful for literary studies be published. 6. In anticipation of these dispositions, We charge Our Venerable Brother Bartholomew, Bishop of Porto and Santa Rufina, Cardinal Pacca of Holy Roman Church and current Camerlengo of the same Holy Roman Church, that in accordance with the tenor of the present, at the beginning of the month of October, he shall make according to law the consignments of the College, with the Church the Church, the Oratory and all its surroundings to the General of the Company himself or to another person delegated by him, so that at the beginning of the following month of November all the schools may be opened under the protection of the Virgin Mother and the other Saints, according to the ancient constitutions and with laws and regulations suited to the needs of the times. 7.

Called by your suffrage, through the inscrutable judgement of God, to the supreme government of the Church, we ascended to the Pontificate not without grave disturbance of Our soul. For if, even in times favourable to the Church, the episcopate has always been a burdensome task, what do we think it will be in the future, in hostile, turbulent and difficult times? 2. What times are we going through? Our soul trembles as We face the duties of the supreme Pontificate and at the same time consider the difficulty of Our times. We know what mission the Pontiff must carry out for the protection and health of the Catholic flock; we do not know in what way it can be carried out while the most unrestrained license, the repression of every right, both human and divine, the contempt of the priesthood and the present captivity of the Church are raging. These are the realities that agitate and unsettle Our soul and that do not allow Us to be serene, nagged as We are, night and day, by the thought of such an onerous task. 3. Yet you have elected Us to the supreme government of the Church in these times? Have You judged Us capable of piloting Peter's ship in the midst of the storms that are raging everywhere, and capable of supporting with Our own strength this burden of which \"even angelic shoulders would be in holy terror\"? But in which ranks have You chosen Us? Certainly in that in which it would be difficult to find someone who in these times, because of his admirable faith in serving the Church, would be considered not only the strongest, able to endure the plundering of goods, imprisonment, exile, the most bitter dangers of death, and therefore be \"an object of wonder to the world, to the angels and to men, in the name of Christ\"; someone who would not only be worthy of such honour, but also much more suitable than Us to bear such a burden, to the supreme glory and security of the Church. 4. What, then, were your decisions? You had at your disposal very wise men to whom you could entrust the Church in the midst of such raging storms. Why did you wish to entrust her to a fool? You had most holy men at your disposal. Why did you choose a sinner? Did Our weakness, which is recognised by all, escape your perspicacity to such an extent that, in such an evident case, you alone did not notice anything? Was it not that the spirit which enlightens and indicates whom to elect was absent from you when your choice fell upon Us? Certainly it was not so, we say with confidence, Venerable Brethren, and we say it not for Our glory, but for the glory of God. It was present, God was present to your most holy minds and We were the only ones you had to choose in any case. Why? Because in your eyes we certainly did not appear worthy, but in the eyes of God we appeared among all the weakest. And God, in order to confound the pride of the strong, in governing his Church always avails himself of the advice of the weak. In truth, the more fragile the means He uses, the more evident it becomes that the Church has its roots in heaven (as Chrysostom teaches) and that God protects her everywhere. 5. Please remember what the beginnings of the nascent Church were. If, therefore, in those early days the fisherman Peter and a few apostles, called from the darkness of Galilee to the light of men to proclaim the Church, under the guidance of God, did so much that their voice spread throughout the whole earth; It must be seen as extraordinary, but certainly not new, that on this island a refuge was also offered to Us who, deprived of everything, asked to provide for the Church after a long raging storm, and this by the admirable providence of God and by concession of the August Emperor (from whom We hope to obtain nothing that does not benefit the defence and greatness of the Church); from the Monastery of that Order, to whose most holy rules we were educated, we have been called to govern the Church in such a way that, the more fragile we are, the more clearly we shall show that it is not governed by Us but by God. 6. So it is God who will rule His Church. Who are We? If we were not sure of the protection of so great a Ruler, conscious of Our weakness, acquiescent to His providence alone, would we not take any care of the Christian flock? On the contrary, we shall be all the more industrious the more we acknowledge ourselves to be weak, and we shall serve the Church as if we had nothing to hope or expect from divine providence. Do we pretend to dominate a reality so complex, so serious, so dangerous, with Our forces alone? But how will we alone be able to sustain so much trouble, so many duties, if you, Venerable Brothers, are not at Our disposal with your help? 7. You understand how unhappy the condition of the Christian world is. You see how much help, in such a corruption of customs, the Christian flock needs for its salvation.

Seeing ourselves, by an impenetrable decree of the wisdom and goodness of God, raised to the sublime degree of the Apostolate, without any merit of our own, while we acknowledge the greatness of His gifts, we are also frightened by the fear of His judgments. Whenever we reflect seriously on the office entrusted to us, the gravity of the burden beats down upon us, the knowledge of our weakness disturbs us, frequent sighs come from the depths of our hearts and copious tears flow from our eyes, to the point that without the help of Him, who placed such a great burden on our shoulders, we would not trust in the future and would even lose all courage. We therefore call for the cooperation of the faithful throughout the Christian world, so that by their concerted efforts, by their most fervent public prayers, by their fasting, by their almsgiving and by all other good works we may invoke divine mercy, by which the Most Gracious Lord may strengthen that which He has already worked in us, May He make known to us His will in full, and may He pour upon us the spirit of wisdom, of understanding, of knowledge, of piety, of prudence and of strength, so that we may know, in the midst of so many difficulties, the duties of Our ministry and carry out rightly the best things, with our eyes always turned to God. Let us all together earnestly pray to the supreme Father of the family that He may watch over the vineyard which He has chosen and planted; that He may sustain in this pilgrimage land, with the gifts of His grace, the people who walk in the way of His precepts, and that He may lead them happily to the prize of eternal happiness which He has promised them. 2. In order to obtain these favours with greater certainty, as was practised in the past by the Supreme Pontiffs Our Predecessors, We have decided to open the treasury of divine graces, the bestowal of which has been entrusted to Our Faith, in order to augur a happy beginning of Our Pontificate. Trusting therefore in the mercy of Almighty God, and in the authority of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, by virtue of the supreme power granted us by the Most High, notwithstanding Our unworthiness, to loosen and bind, We hereby grant an indulgence and plenary remission of all sins to the faithful of either sex who, wherever they may be in the world, within the space of fifteen consecutive days or two weeks, counting from the day appointed as the beginning by their Ordinaries or vicars or officials, or those who have charge of souls by their mandate, from the date of receipt of this Letter, have devoutly prayed to God for some time, and on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday of one of the two aforementioned weeks have fasted, and after confessing their sins have received the Sacrament of the Most Holy Eucharist on the Sunday immediately following or on another day of the first week.

Seafarers and all those on the way, as soon as they have reached their homes, performed the prescribed devotions and visited the cathedral, major or parish church of the place where they are staying, may obtain the same indulgence. 3.

Who would not be seized with profound sadness, seeing with their own eyes and with the greatest attention how distressing is the state of the Catholic religion and of this Apostolic See? Who, finally, would not weep all his tears for the many horrible wounds inflicted on our faith, our discipline and our rights? But it is not the case to recall and recall so many evils and to pass over in silence the remedies with which we can confront so many calamities. There is no illness so serious, so obstinate, so desperate, that it cannot be healed or at least helped by Almighty God by virtue of His ineffable mercy, which transcends our ability to understand it. Let us therefore approach His Throne with confidence, in the proper manner.

Let us therefore turn to God with all our hearts, in fasting, in weeping, in lamenting, and let us not turn our eyes away from the poor, so that it does not happen that the Lord turns his eyes away from us.

With the blessing of God, We also grant the Jubilee to those who have visited at least once the Churches or Basilicas of Saint John Lateran, of the Prince of Apostles, and the aforesaid Basilica of Saint Mary Major or any of them within the same week or in the week following, and have there for some time raised devout prayers to God; and who, on the fourth and sixth feast days and on the Saturday of either of the two aforementioned weeks, have fasted and, after confessing their sins, have devoutly approached the Blessed Sacrament of the Eucharist on the following Sunday or on another day within the same week, and have given some alms to the poor, in such measure as devotion suggests to each. 3.

Pope Benedict XIV. Venerable Brothers, Health and Apostolic Blessing. Among those who profess the Catholic Faith there is no one who does not know how much care must be taken not only that the Sacred Sacrifice of the Mass be celebrated with all the worship and veneration proper to Religion, but also that from the dignity of so high a Sacrifice there be eliminated opportunities for gain of any kind, contracts and those importunate and illiberal requests for alms (which are rather exactions) and other similar things which are not far from ignominious simony, or at least from foul gain. 1. Indeed, it is not without great pain in Our heart that We have come to know that avarice - which is servitude to idols - has progressed to such an extent that some people, both clergy and laity, accumulate, for the celebration of Masses, both alms and the fees provided for by local customs or the Dispositions of Diocesan Synods as a subsidy for the maintenance of the individual priest. On the contrary, they shall see to it that Masses are celebrated elsewhere when the alms or fees for each Mass are less, according to custom or Synodal law, than those paid where they are received. 2. How much this is discordant and how much it is extraneous to the will, whether expressed or tacit, of the devout offerers, everyone can easily understand. Nor should it be interpreted otherwise. For each one wishes that the Masses should be celebrated in that Church to which, moved by the impulses of religion and piety, he brings his alms, or in which, by chance, one of his own has been buried, rather than in another Church which is completely unknown to him. This fact, of being induced almost to bargain because of a shameful greed for gain, is not only not exempt from the suspicion and guilt of avarice, but not even from the crime of theft, so that it is subject to the obligation of restitution. It follows that many good people, knowing of such a market, are strongly indignant and refrain from offering alms for the celebration of Masses. 3. The Roman Pontiffs, Our Predecessors, deploring this execrable abuse that was gradually creeping in here and there, wanted that by a measure of the Congregation of the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church of the Universal Inquisition against Evil Heresies, as well as the Congregation of the Cardinals interpreters of the Council of Trent, it be prescribed that no priest, once he has received from any person a large sum of money or alms for celebrating Mass, may give to another priest who is about to celebrate Mass a smaller sum or alms, even if he declares to the priest celebrating Mass (and with the latter's consent) that he has received a larger sum or alms. 4. We therefore beseech you and earnestly exhort you in the name of the Lord, Venerable Brothers who are called to be part of the Apostolic Ministry and of Our endeavour, to guard your flock insomnably, so that such an infection may not spread further, but may be completely eliminated. For from avarice all evils grow, as from a root. Some who practiced avarice turned away from the Faith and plunged into many afflictions. Certainly there is no contagion that can more than avarice pollute and uproot the accepted opinion of perfect priestly dignity. Avarice, by teaching people to put God before riches and to serve Mammon, causes the avaricious to receive no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. If avarice is not tolerated at all among the laity (and even infringed by law), how can it be tolerated among Churchmen, who have divorced themselves from earthly goods, who have been called to the service of the Lord, and who have subjected themselves to God? What is to become of them, when in such a sordid manner, not through worldly gain, but through the ministry of the Altar, in contempt of most holy laws, they are led with a thoughtless spirit into avarice, dishonouring the priestly order? Therefore, Venerable Brethren, to whom the care of Christ's sheep has been entrusted, strive not only to precede all by word and example, but to be in every place the good fragrance of Christ, so that the people may follow your steps. Moreover, by removing first of all the clergy, then the laity, from the defiled pastures of vice, teach them to run towards the Heavenly fold along the path of God's precepts.","pope":"Benedict XIV","type":"Quanta Cura","year":1741}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610a59d0677c250714c80384"},"text":"Last year, in a letter dated 15 October to the Cardinal Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of Studies, we stated that we would like to see the complete publication of all the works of St Thomas Aquinas. We said that the reason for this resolution was to spread everywhere the unique wisdom of the Angelic Doctor, of which there is almost nothing more suitable for repressing the perverse opinions of our times, nothing more effective for preserving the truth. But since it now seems opportune to take up the initiative, we believe we must lay down some rules to nourish the hope of seeing Our enterprise crowned with the desired result. First of all, therefore, in order that Our Supreme City may not lack this pride, we wish the above edition to be reserved for the Printing House of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, which is already known for publishing other volumes of a commendable and extensive work. To take care of the publication and to preside over the initiative with special authority we assign three Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, namely, Antonino De Luca, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Studies; Giovanni Simeoni, Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith; and Tommaso Zigliara of the Order of St. Dominic, who is totally dedicated to Thomistic disciplines and a scholar in them. To these we delegate the right and the power to establish and dispose in Our name whatever they may deem fit. Let them therefore see to it that each and every work of the Angelic Doctor is brought to light in its entirety, with the addition of the commentaries of the most accredited interpreters, namely Tommaso de Vio Cardinal Gaetano for the Summa Theologica, and Francesco Silvestri known as il Ferrarese for the Summa contra Gentiles. Similarly, they should take care and endeavour to ensure that the best form of type is not left to be desired, as well as diligent correction and all wise discernment in the choice of individual items; finally, they should establish the order and time in which each volume should be published. As for the expenses, we willingly contribute the sum of 300,000 Italian lire, which we are making available to cover the present needs. For the future, then, we want the expenses to be borne by the treasury of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide itself, to which, however, we will refund from the proceeds of the sale of the printed copies the sum that equals that expense. If anything remains, we order that all the money be used for the publication of the works of those writers who most distinguish themselves in illustrating the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas. The Cardinals themselves, whom we have named, will decide which of these writers should be given precedence. We only note that preference should be given to those writers whose doctrine can bear greater fruit and seems more in keeping with the needs of the times.","pope":"Leo XIII","type":"Placere Nobis","year":1880}

The great sign which the Apostle John saw in heaven, \"a woman clothed with the sun,\"(1) is interpreted by the sacred Liturgy,(2) not without foundation, as referring to the most blessed Mary, the mother of all men by the grace of Christ the Redeemer. The memory, venerable brothers, is still vivid in our mind of the great emotion we felt in proclaiming the august Mother of God as the spiritual Mother of the Church, that is to say, of all the faithful and of the sacred pastors, as the crowning of the third session of the Second Vatican Council, after having solemnly promulgated the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church.(3) Great also was the happiness of numerous Council Fathers, as well as of the faithful, who were present at the sacred rite in St. Peter's basilica and of the entire Christian people scattered throughout the world. The memory came spontaneously to many minds of the first grandiose triumph achieved by the humble \"handmaid of the Lord\"(4) when the Fathers from East and West, gathered in an ecumenical council at Ephesus in the year 431, greeted Mary as \"Theotokos\" - genitrix of God. The Christian population of the illustrious city associated themselves with a jubilant impulse of faith with the exultance of the Fathers and accompanied them with torchlights to their dwelling. Oh! with how much maternal satisfaction the Virgin Mary must have looked on the pastors and the faithful in that glorious hour of the history of the Church, recognizing in the hymns of praise, raised in honor principally of the Son and then in her own, the echo of the prophetic canticle which she herself on the impulse of the Holy Spirit had raised to the Most High; \"My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, because He has regarded the lowliness of His handmaid; for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call me blessed; because He who is mighty has done great things for me and holy is His name.\"(5) On the occasion of the religious ceremonies which are taking place at this time in honor of the Virgin Mother of God in Fatima, Portugal, where she is venerated by countless numbers of the faithful for her motherly and compassionate heart,(6) we wish to call the attention of all sons of the Church once more to the indissoluble link between the spiritual motherhood of Mary, so amply illustrated in the (council's) Dogmatic Constitution on the Church(7) and the duties of redeemed men toward her, the Mother of the Church. Once it is acknowledged, by virtue of the numerous testimonies offered by the sacred texts and by the holy Fathers and remembered in the constitution mentioned above, that \"Mary, the Mother of God and Mother of the Redeemer\"(8) has been \"united to Him by a close and indissoluble tie\"(9) and that she has a most singular role in \"the mystery of the Incarnate Word and of the Mystical Body,\"(10) that is to say, in \"the economy of salvation,\"(11) it appears evident that the Virgin is \"rightly honored by the Church with a special veneration,(12) particularly liturgical,\"(13) not only as \"the most holy Mother of God, who took part in the mysteries of Christ,\"(14) but also \"as the Mother of the Church.\"(15) Nor is it to be feared that liturgical reform, if put into practice according to the formula \"the law of faith must establish the law of prayer\"(16) may be detrimental to the \"wholly singular\" veneration(17) due to the Virgin Mary for her prerogatives, first among these being the dignity of the Mother of God. Nor is it to be feared that the greater veneration, liturgical as well as private, given to her may obscure or diminish \"the adoration which is offered to the Incarnate Word, as well as the Father and to the Holy Spirit.\"(18) Accordingly, without wishing to restate here, venerable brothers, the traditional doctrine of the Church regarding the function of the Mother of God on the plane of salvation and her relations with the Church, we believe that, if we dwell on the consideration of two truths which are very important for the renewal of Christian life, we would be doing something of great utility for the souls of the faithful.","pope":"Paul VI","type":"Signum Magnum","year":1967}

And so, because love when it is true and deeply felt tends of its own nature to manifest itself through ever renewed demonstrations, the faithful have vied with one another all through the centuries in expressing at all times their ardent piety toward the Queen of Heaven. In our opinion, this is the reason why, for a long time past, numerous petitions (those received from 1849 to 1940 have been gathered in two volumes which, accompanied with suitable comments, have been recently printed), from cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, priests, religious of both sexes, associations, universities and innumerable private persons have reached the Holy See, all begging that the bodily Assumption into heaven of the Blessed Virgin should be defined and proclaimed as a dogma of faith. And certainly no one is unaware of the fact that this was fervently requested by almost two hundred fathers in the Vatican Council. 3. But We, who are charged with the care of defending and developing the Kingdom of Christ, have at the same time to exercise continual care and vigilance to keep away everything adverse to this Kingdom, and to support whatsoever may promote it. Therefore, from the beginning of Our Pontificate, we had to examine most carefully whether it would be lawful, convenient and useful to support with Our authority the above mentioned petitions. We have not neglected and do not at present neglect to offer insistent prays to God that He might clearly manifest the will of His ever-adorable goodness in this instance. 4. In order that We may receive the gift of heavenly light, do you, Venerable Brethren, in pious competition, unite your entreaties with Ours. But, while paternally exhorting you to do this, thus following the example of Our Predecessors, and particularly that of Pius IX when about to define the dogma of the Mother of God's Immaculate Conception, we earnestly beg you to inform us about the devotion of your clergy and people (taking into account their faith and piety) toward the Assumption of the most Blessed Virgin Mary. More especially We wish to know if you, Venerable Brethren, with your learning and prudence consider that the bodily Assumption of the Immaculate Blessed Virgin can be proposed and defined as a dogma of faith, and whether in addition to your own wishes this is desired by your clergy and people. 5. We shall be most grateful for your prompt response and we entreat an abundance of divine favors and the favorable assistance of the heavenly Virgin upon you, venerable brothers, and upon yours, while we most lovingly impart our apostolic blessing in the Lord as a token of our fatherly affection to you and to the flocks committed to your care.","pope":"Pius XII","type":"Encyclical","year":1946}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610a5c49677c250714c80387"},"text":"The moment has finally arrived for Us to announce the solution which We have arrived at on the important and very grave problem of Diocesan Associations. In laying bare before you, as We now do, the processes We have followed in arriving at this conclusion, We deem it Our duty to recall to memory and to place before your very eyes, as if they were pictures, the different steps in the negotiations which were taken with reference to this particular subject. We shall be able to do this quite briefly since We deal with a matter, the history of which is in great part already perfectly known to you. 2. We recall, but with sorrow, those sad days when in your country the evil project of separating the interests of the Republic from those of the Church was conceived and how, what is more unfortunate, steps were taken to put the project into execution. We cannot forget either how, at one fell stroke, the relations which existed between the Holy See and France were brusquely and unjustly broken off, how on December 9, 1905, the law of separation was passed by which the Concordat which had been in force over a long period of time was abrogated by but one party to the contract in direct violation of all the formalities demanded by law, how also, without the slightest regard either for the hierarchy of the Church or for the authority of the Holy See, unjust and arbitrary laws were enacted concerning the rights and possessions of the Church, as well as on the subject of divine worship. Neither can We forget how Our Predecessor of saintly memory, Pius X, in his encyclical Vehementer of February 11, 1906, and in the allocution which he made at the Consistory of February 21, the same year, condemned in no uncertain terms and with all possible solemnity this very law; nor how he condemned, at the same time, the so called \"Associations Cultuelles\" which were to be established in the spirit of that law, Associations which in another encyclical Gravissimo of August 10, of that year, the same Pope rejected once more and condemned. 3. The \"Associations Cultuelles\" did not come into existence, and therefore several persons - We use the words of Our Predecessor - thought it opportune to try, if possible, to create in their place another type of organization which would conform at one and the same time with the laws of France and the canons of the Church, and which would, considering the sad times which seemed to loom up in the near distance, be able to preserve intact, at least in substance, the sacrosanct rights of Holy Church. But as such a result seemed impossible of achievement at that time, Pope Pius, after consultation with the bishops of France, forbade any attempt to form this new type of Association, at least as long as the law of separation remained on the statute books, and until it could be established legally and beyond all doubt that in these same Associations the divine constitution of the Church, the inalienable rights of the Roman Pontiff and of the hierarchy, as well as the Church's authority over her property and, particularly over church buildings, would be both respected and safeguarded. 4. You know only too well what followed upon this decision. The entire Catholic world looked on and was filled with admiration at the course of events. For precisely that which the Supreme Pontiff, Pius X, in the letter which We have referred to had asked of you, had with confidence recommended, and had even, if We may say so, foreseen, yes, that very course of action which you preached both by word and by example as the only solution of the problem, that finally and happily came to pass. Mankind witnessed the glorious spectacle of the clergy and the faithful of France rivaling each other day by day in fervor, in generosity, in devoted sacrifice. On the one hand, the faithful gave most generously and in abundance their offerings for the decorous upkeep of divine worship and for the adequate maintenance of their priests. On their side, the clergy willingly and even gladly submitted to the hard conditions of life which came into existence as a result of the law of separation. 5. It must also be added here that the sacred ministry, which is more closely united with the public welfare than any other vocation, was, because of that law, hampered in its activities and made still less efficient in its work through the expulsion of many of its needed helpers and coadjutors. The clergy, too, were deprived of all income from property, a fact which exposed them to a condition in which they were oftentimes in dire need of even the bare necessities of life. 6. The devoted and noble-minded rivalry between the clergy and laity, which existed under these trying circumstances, was of such a character that We in all justice may call it heroic, and We Ourselves, years ago, followed its course with the liveliest interest. From the beginning of Our Pontificate We have appreciated the remarkable economic advance which has been made and have noted, too, that the spirit of union has not been diminished, neither has it been in danger of being weakened. As a matter of fact, the economic condition of the Church of France, according to the views of several bishops, is such that it does not appear to be in need of an immediate remedy. On the other hand, both the organization and administration of the patrimony of the Church, despite the fact that it is often beset with difficulties and hampered by obstacles and, because of this unjust law, exposed to many dangers, has not been completely deprived of a support which has its base in the common law. 7. In spite of such facts, the lack of a sound juridical foundation for these rights carries along in its wake a certain instability as far as these rights themselves and all other matters of the Church are concerned, which together with the almost universal troubles of the present times and the widespread confusion have become to Us a source of great anxiety and of mental preoccupation. For these reasons it appeared opportune to try every possible means which might help to relieve or remedy the existing situation. 8. This consciousness of Our duty grew all the more pressing as the belief gradually became more and more general that intervention on Our part would assist greatly in bringing about a more general peace among men, a peace which, like yourselves, We now desire, as We have always desired it, even from the first day when We, not by reason of any merits on Our part but because of a hidden decree of Divine Providence itself, were raised to the sublime office of the Common Father of all the faithful. 9. The ending of the terrible War through which the world has passed and the story of the glorious deeds of the clergy, both regular and secular, forgetting the insults they had received and remembering only their love of country, which was made known to all, caused to grow from day to day a profound desire for the re-establishment of religious peace broken by the law of separation, the result of which peace would be that the status of the Catholic Church in France would be made more conformable to the dictates of justice, should it be able to function under the sanction of law. 10. Out of this desire for peace has come the problem of Diocesan Associations. The statutes of these Associations, drawn up by competent scholars, who did not act without the consent of the heads of the French Government, were first sent to the Holy See by Our Nunzio in France. They were then forwarded to you, as well as to Our Venerable Brothers, the Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, who are members of the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. The views of both these parties were asked for more than once. Finally, these questions were examined by Us personally. 11. One can readily understand that it was not easy for Us to pass judgment on this question. In the first place, We could not and We did not even wish it to be made to appear that We were willing to accept a different solution from that which had been outlined by Pius X. Both the memory and the position taken by the great Pontiff who was Our Predecessor made such a course impossible; the violation of the rights of this Apostolic See and of the hierarchy, rights which are the rights of God and of souls, simply forbade such a course. What We did do was to ask for the prayers of many of the faithful, and We too lifted Our heart to God in prayer, and then after considering at great length the matter in the Divine Presence, We confirmed the condemnation which had been made of the iniquitous law of separation, but at the same time concluded that, due to the change in public opinion, and, due also to the different circumstances and relations between the Holy See and the French Republic which had toward the end of 1922 been so profoundly changed, We did not see any difficulty which would keep Us from allowing the Diocesan Associations to come into existence, at least as an experiment, but only on the following condition. First, the statutes would have to be corrected in such a way that they would conform, both in their general tenor and in their essential nature, with the divine constitution and laws of the Church. Secondly, We must be given certain guaranties, protected by law, which would remove as far as possible all danger that in case men hostile to the Church should come into power in the Republic, they might be able to refuse to recognize the legal existence and the legal rights of these Associations, and thus expose them to the possibility of losing their property which they held under the law. 12. These statutes have been discussed at length and with great care by both parties. The outcome of these discussions is that the Diocesan Associations which are contemplated by this plan are quite different from those which Pius X condemned and had refused permission to organize.","pope":"Pius XI","type":"Encyclical","year":1924}

Hence the machinations and frauds, hence the open violence recently used, when improvised bands of the lowest plebs, ready for every misdeed, entered our provinces to raise the banner of rebellion: by terror, robbery and every sacrilegious wickedness they brought desolation to villages, towns and cities without, however, succeeding in driving the people from their due faith, from their obedience to Us and the Apostolic See. In such a difficult situation, the exceptional valour of Our soldiers shone forth. In fact, following their commanders, not at all terrified by the roughness of the road and not even afflicted by the length of the march or exhausted by the fatigue, they ran with alacrity to counteract the impetus of the enemies. After they had started a fight against them and had renewed it in several places, they fought with so much spirit and courage that they defeated and dispersed the heinous hosts and restored peace and security to the townspeople and citizens. Not long afterwards, a band in arms dared to approach the walls of Rome and attempt an assault, in order to vent their restrained fury by burning, pillaging houses, destroying temples, and shedding the blood of honest citizens, as soon as the signal for a conspiracy was given by the accomplices of their treachery (who had sneaked into the city and prepared new instruments of death). But Our soldiers did not fail in their duty; for when they discovered the snares, they made the treachery of the conspirators vain, and having crushed and slain a part of them and thrown another part into prison, they saved this seat of religion, this abode of the fine arts, from imminent extermination. The militia Nostra then had another opportunity to prove their worth. A hoard of armed men, gathered everywhere in the neighbouring province of Sabina, had occupied Monterotondo; there they committed many unworthy deeds and, inflamed by unbridled greed, meditated a new aggression against Rome; but our troops and French auxiliary troops were sent to attack the enemy. They engaged in battle near Mentana, and showed such strength, ardour and constancy in the fight that they tamed and routed that raiding party, although superior in number. They wounded and killed many of them, took many others to prison, and put the rest to flight with their daring leader, thus achieving a splendid victory. The victorious hosts then returned to Rome and were given a triumphant welcome. The citizens went to meet them, and with shouts and applause celebrated the great feat of those brave men. But in order that the memory of this victory, which was achieved not without the help of God, and was celebrated and praised everywhere, may be perpetuated in all ages, we have had a silver frieze coined in the form of an octagonal cross, at the ends of which is written Pius PP. IX. An. MDCCCLXVII. In the centre there should be a small medal bearing on the obverse the emblems of papal dignity with the inscription Fidei et Virtuti, and on the reverse the cross with the inscription Hinc Victoria. To each and every soldier present in Our army We grant to wear this silver frieze on the left side of the breast, suspended from a ribbon of white silk distinguished with five blue stripes; and for greater recompense of the deed We grant to the same that one year be deducted from the stipulated time to obtain higher pay and to obtain other benefits according to military regulations. We also grant the same silver frieze, to be worn on the left side of the breast, to each and every soldier of the French army who fought alongside Our troops against the hostile forces at Mentana. Finally, in order that those valiant men who offered their blood and their lives to defend Our rights and to drive out from Rome the fury of the impious, may receive from Us a solemn proclamation of valour and praise, we publish and declare with this letter that they have acquired great merit with Us, with the Apostolic See and the Catholic world: a proclamation of which nothing is more honourable, more glorious, more suitable to make their name immortal.","pope":"Pius IX","type":"Ex quo infensissimi","year":1867}

And since in the same letter we announced that on this occasion we would once again offer the heavenly treasures of the Church, we are sending you this letter with which we unveil those very treasures. Trusting therefore in the mercy of Almighty God and in the authority of Saints Peter and Paul His Apostles, with the power to bind and loose which the Lord has, however unworthily, entrusted to us, we hereby grant and bestow in the form of a Jubilee the widest indulgence of all sins - which by way of suffrage may also be applied to the souls in purgatory - to all the faithful and to each one individually of both sexes in your dioceses: a) who within a month, to be determined by each of you and to be calculated from the day which each of you will have indicated, have confessed their sins humbly and with sincere repentance and, purified by sacramental absolution, have received with veneration the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist; b) who have visited three churches designated by you or three times one of them and have therein for a suitable length of time raised pious prayers to God for the exaltation and prosperity of Holy Mother Church and the Apostolic See, for the extirpation of heresies and for peace and concord among the Christian princes, and for the peace and unity of the whole Christian people; c) who, moreover, within the above-mentioned period of time have fasted once and have, each according to his own charity, given some alms to the poor and a pious donation in favour of the venerable work of the Propagation of the Faith (which we warmly recommend to your episcopal zeal). In order that the nuns and other persons who live perpetually in the cloister may also gain this indulgence, as well as anyone who lives in prison, or who because of physical infirmity or any other impediment is unable to perform any of the above-mentioned works, we grant the Confessors, who are to be chosen for them in the manner described below, the power to commute them into other works of piety and to defer them to another time in the near future, with the faculty also to dispense from Communion children who have not yet been admitted to First Communion. Likewise, to the faithful of your dioceses, whether lay or ecclesiastical, secular or regular, and belonging to any institute, including those who would require special mention, we grant licence and faculty to choose as Confessor for this reason any secular or regular priest from among those whom you will deem most suitable for this purpose. (Nuns, even if they are exempt from the jurisdiction of the Ordinary, and other women who live in cloisters may also avail themselves of this faculty, provided that the confessor is approved for nuns). They will be able in the internal forum, and for this time only, to absolve from excommunication, suspension, interdict and other ecclesiastical sentences and censures inflicted for any reason by law or by judge, except those excepted below, and from all sins, transgressions, crimes and offences, however serious and enormous, even those reserved to the Ordinaries of places or, in a special form, to the Apostolic See and whose absolution was not intended to be granted at other times through a general indult of this nature. Moreover, in order to make the way of salvation easier for all, we grant to the same Confessors, recalling the period of a single month, also the faculty of absolving all those who have unluckily joined prohibited sects and who sincerely repent the Sacrament of Reconciliation, and the power to dispense them, in order to obtain the same Plenary Indulgence, from the obligation to denounce their accomplices, applying the usual conditions and excepting cases in which denunciation appears absolutely necessary to avoid greater and more serious damage. In addition, we grant that confessors, imposing in every case a healthy penance and all that must normally be imposed, may dispense with and commute in other pious works vows of every kind, even those sworn and reserved to the Apostolic See (of chastity, religion and obligation, excepting always those taken by a third person and those in which the harm of a third person is involved, besides of course penalties which are considered to be such as to preserve from sin, unless the possible commutation is judged to be such as to turn away from sin no less than the previous nature of the vow).","pope":"Pius IX","type":"Encyclical","year":1851}

That upon the solidity of the stone the Church was founded by Christ, and that Peter, by a singular gift of Christ, was chosen in preference to all others to be Prince of the Apostolic Choir, with power to act in his stead, and that he consequently took the supreme care and authority to shepherd the whole flock, to confirm the brethren, and to dissolve and bind throughout the world, is a Catholic dogma which, received from the mouth of Christ, taught and defended by the continuous preaching of the Fathers, has been sanctely held in every age by the universal Church, and often confirmed against the errors of the innovators by the decrees of the Supreme Pontiffs and Councils. In this Principality of the Apostolic Chair, Christ glued together the bond of unity, so that the Church, which was to spread over the whole world, would be united by its components, however distant they might be, with a mutual association of all in one head. It would then happen that the strength of this power would be valid not only for the breadth of the first See, but above all for the integrity and salvation of the whole body. Hence it is not to be wondered at that those who in all past centuries, when the ancient enemy of mankind poured out his hatred against the Church, first of all hurled themselves against this See, in which is contained the steadfastness of unity, so that, having disintegrated - if possible - the foundation, and destroyed the connection of the Churches with the Head, on which above all they are sustained, vigorous, and flourishing, they would strip the same Church, miserably afflicted and lacerated by broken forces, of that freedom which Christ had given her, and subject her to an unworthy slavery. 2. A few years ago Eybel, a man of lively intellect, already too well known for pamphlets which have long since been condemned, gave a new testimony of his aggressive spirit against Us and this Apostolic See. Having heard of the journey undertaken by Us for religious reasons, he hastened to circulate among his compatriots a pamphlet with this unbelievable title: What is the Pope? With it he intended to reduce the pious commitment that Our arrival had created, and to make the dignity of the papacy odious to the priestly order and contemptible to the common people. But the merciful God did not allow him to fulfil his despicable vow, for we were received with such solemnity and participation of his countrymen, whom he had attempted to alienate from Us, and with so much consideration and applause from all quarters that it was made manifest that, although without any merit of Our own we had been raised by the will of divine providence to the seat of Peter, yet by the divine decision of the Lord Himself provision had been made that the unworthiness of the successor should not prejudice the honour due to Peter. 3. But at that time we thought it advisable to refrain from censuring that pamphlet with the deserved condemnation, first, lest it should appear to the most suspicious, who never fail to be suspicious, that we had rather acquiesced in Our sorrow than fulfilled Our duty; and secondly, because it might be thought that such a pamphlet would soon fall into oblivion, since, in itself, it was of no value and added nothing beyond a certain, more than impudent, licence in weaving the old slanders. But we have recently learned that certain enemies, always ready to sow abundant dissension, were endeavouring to have the work, of modest substance, reprinted repeatedly, not only in the original language, but translated into several others, even into the vernacular Greek, and circulated widely. They were motivated by the intention and hope that the license of the ridiculous writing would entice many to read it, and that the audacity of the writer in his statements might deceive the unwary, of whom there are many. We realized that on Our part there should be no delay in counteracting, as far as We could, the evil that was growing day by day; We should strive with all diligence and by every means that those who seek (God willing that they be not domestic enemies) to affect the peace and unity of the Church might be recalled to a more wholesome purpose, so that the good faithful, ensnared by the falsehoods of such, might not be miserably led away from the security of the Orthodox Faith towards the profane novelties of the rising errors.

{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf114733bdc0178ba0326"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Good morning, The Synod of Bishops on the Family, recently celebrated, was the first stage of a journey, which will conclude next October with the celebration of another Assembly on the theme: “The Vocation and Mission of the Family in the Church and [Contemporary] World”. The prayer and reflection which must accompany this journey is required of all the People of God. I would also like the customary meditations of the Wednesday Audiences to be included in this common journey. I have therefore decided to reflect with you, this year, precisely on the family, on this great gift that the Lord has made to the world from the very beginning, when he entrusted Adam and Eve with the mission to multiply and fill the earth (cf. Gen 1:28); that gift that Jesus confirmed and sealed in his Gospel. The nearness of Christmas casts a great light on this mystery. The Incarnation of the Son of God opens a new beginning in the universal history of man and woman. And this new beginning happens within a family, in Nazareth. Jesus was born in a family. He could have come in a spectacular way, or as a warrior, an emperor.... No, no: he is born in a family, in a family. This is important: to perceive in the nativity, this beautiful scene. God chose to come into the world in a human family, which He himself formed. He formed it in a remote village on the outskirts of the Roman Empire. Not in Rome, which was the capital of the Empire, not in a big city, but on its nearly invisible outskirts, indeed, of little renown. The Gospels also recall this, almost as an expression: “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” (Jn 1:46). Perhaps, in many parts of the world, we still talk this way, when we hear the name of some areas on the periphery of a big city. And so, right there, on the outskirts of the great Empire, began the most holy and good story of Jesus among men! And that is where this family was. Jesus dwelt on that periphery for 30 years. The Evangelist Luke summarizes this period like this: Jesus “was obedient to them”; — that is, to Mary and Joseph. And someone might say: “But did this God, who comes to save us, waste 30 years there, in that suburban slum?”. He wasted 30 years! He wanted this. Jesus’ path was in that family — “and his mother kept all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man” (Lk 2:51-52). It does not recount miracles or healing, or preaching — He did none in that period — or of crowds flocking; in Nazareth everything seemed to happen “normally”, according to the customs of a pious and hardworking Israelite family: they worked, the mother cooked, she did all the housework, ironed shirts... all the things mothers do. The father, a carpenter, worked, taught his son the trade. Thirty years. “But what a waste, Father!”. God works in mysterious ways. But what was important there was the family! And this was not a waste! They were great saints: Mary, the most holy woman, immaculate, and Joseph, a most righteous man.... The family. We are certainly moved by the story of how the adolescent Jesus followed the religious calendar of the community and the social duties; in knowing how, as a young worker, He worked with Joseph; and then how He attended the reading of the Scriptures, in praying the Psalms and in so many other customs of daily life. The Gospels, in their sobriety, make no reference to Jesus’ adolescence and leave this task to our loving meditation. Art, literature, music have taken this journey through imagination. It is certainly not difficult to imagine how much mothers could learn from Mary’s care for that Son! And how much fathers could glean from the example of Joseph, a righteous man, who dedicated his life to supporting and protecting the Child and his wife — his family — in difficult times. Not to mention how much children could be encouraged by the adolescent Jesus to understand the necessity and beauty of cultivating their most profound vocation and of dreaming great dreams! In those 30 years, Jesus cultivated his vocation, for which the Father had sent him. And in that time, Jesus never became discouraged, but increased in courage in order to carry his mission forward. Each Christian family can first of all — as Mary and Joseph did — welcome Jesus, listen to Him, speak with Him, guard Him, protect Him, grow with Him; and in this way improve the world. Let us make room in our heart and in our day for the Lord. As Mary and Joseph also did, and it was not easy: how many difficulties they had to overcome! They were not a superficial family, they were not an unreal family. The family of Nazareth urges us to rediscover the vocation and mission of the family, of every family. And, what happened in those 30 years in Nazareth, can thus happen to us too: in seeking to make love and not hate normal, making mutual help commonplace, not indifference or enmity. It is no coincidence, then, that “Nazareth” means “She who keeps”, as Mary, who — as the Gospel states — “kept all these things in her heart” (cf. Lk 2:19, 51). Since then, each time there is a family that keeps this mystery, even if it were on the periphery of the world, the mystery of the Son of God, the mystery of Jesus who comes to save us, the mystery is at work. He comes to save the world. And this is the great mission of the family: to make room for Jesus who is coming, to welcome Jesus in the family, in each member: children, husband, wife, grandparents.... Jesus is there. Welcome him there, in order that He grow spiritually in the family. May the Lord grant us this grace in these last days of Advent. Thank you. ","pope":"Francis","type":"Audience","year":2014}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf18a733bdc0178ba0327"},"text":"To Professor Klaus Schwab Executive President of the World Economic Forum Before all else, I would like to thank you for your gracious invitation to address the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos-Klosters at the end of January on the theme: “Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution”. I offer you my cordial good wishes for the fruitfulness of this meeting, which seeks to encourage continuing social and environmental responsibility through a constructive dialogue on the part of government, business and civic leaders, as well as distinguished representatives of the political, financial and cultural sectors. The dawn of the so-called “fourth industrial revolution” has been accompanied by a growing sense of the inevitability of a drastic reduction in the number of jobs. The latest studies conducted by the International Labour Organization indicate that unemployment presently affects hundreds of millions of people. The financialization and technologization of national and global economies have produced far-reaching changes in the field of labour. Diminished opportunities for useful and dignified employment, combined with a reduction in social security, are causing a disturbing rise in inequality and poverty in different countries. Clearly there is a need to create new models of doing business which, while promoting the development of advanced technologies, are also capable of using them to create dignified work for all, to uphold and consolidate social rights, and to protect the environment. Man must guide technological development, without letting himself be dominated by it! To all of you I appeal once more: “Do not forget the poor!” This is the primary challenge before you as leaders in the business world. “Those who have the means to enjoy a decent life, rather than being concerned with privileges, must seek to help those poorer than themselves to attain dignified living conditions, particularly through the development of their human, cultural, economic and social potential” (Address to Civic and Business Leaders and the Diplomatic Corps, Bangui, 29 November 2015). We must never allow the culture of prosperity to deaden us, to make us incapable of “feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, weeping for other people’s pain, and sensing the need to help them, as though all this were someone else’s responsibility and not our own” (Evangelii Gaudium, 54). Weeping for other people’s pain does not only mean sharing in their sufferings, but also and above all realizing that our own actions are a cause of injustice and inequality. “Let us open our eyes, then, and see the misery of the world, the wounds of our brothers and sisters who are denied their dignity, and let us recognize that we are compelled to heed their cry for help! May we reach out to them and support them so they can feel the warmth of our presence, our friendship, and our fraternity! May their cry become our own, and together may we break down the barriers of indifference that too often reign supreme and mask our hypocrisy and egoism!” (Bull of Indiction of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Misericordiae Vultus, 15). Once we realize this, we become more fully human, since responsibility for our brothers and sisters is an essential part of our common humanity. Do not be afraid to open your minds and hearts to the poor. In this way, you will give free rein to your economic and technical talents, and discover the happiness of a full life, which consumerism of itself cannot provide. In the face of profound and epochal changes, world leaders are challenged to ensure that the coming “fourth industrial revolution”, the result of robotics and scientific and technological innovations, does not lead to the destruction of the human person – to be replaced by a soulless machine – or to the transformation of our planet into an empty garden for the enjoyment of a chosen few. On the contrary, the present moment offers a precious opportunity to guide and govern the processes now under way, and to build inclusive societies based on respect for human dignity, tolerance, compassion and mercy. I urge you, then, to take up anew your conversation on how to build the future of the planet, “our common home”, and I ask you to make a united effort to pursue a sustainable and integral development. As I have often said, and now willingly reiterate, business is “a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving our world”, especially “if it sees the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good” (Laudato Si’, 129). As such, it has a responsibility to help overcome the complex crisis of society and the environment, and to fight poverty. This will make it possible to improve the precarious living conditions of millions of people and bridge the social gap which gives rise to numerous injustices and erodes fundamental values of society, including equality, justice and solidarity. In this way, through the preferred means of dialogue, the World Economic Forum can become a platform for the defence and protection of creation and for the achievement of a progress which is “healthier, more human, more social, more integral” (Laudato Si’, 112), with due regard also for environmental goals and the need to maximize efforts to eradicate poverty as set forth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Mr President, with renewed good wishes for the success of the forthcoming meeting in Davos, I invoke upon you and upon all taking part in the Forum, together with your families, God’s abundant blessings.","pope":"Francis","type":"Message","year":2015}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf1c6733bdc0178ba0328"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, We meet again for this beautiful family moment, to exchange Christmas wishes. It is a moment that I greatly appreciate, because it is the occasion for us to come together, everyone, along with your family members, wives and husbands, children, parents, who are often grandparents.... First of all, I would like, with you, to thank the Lord for all his gifts. For it is true that in these days one thinks of Christmas presents, but in reality the One who gives the true gift is He, our Father, who gives us Jesus. Our presents, this beautiful tradition of exchanging presents, should express precisely this: a reflection of the unique gift that is his Son made man and born of the Virgin Mary. Today we wish to thank God first of all for the gift of work. Work is extremely important, both for the actual person who works and for his or her family. As we give thanks, let us pray for the people and the families, in Italy and throughout the world, who have no work, or else, often, who do work that is undignified, poorly paid, or harmful to health.... We must always thank God for work. And we must be committed, each one with his or her own responsibility, to ensuring that work is dignified, respectful of the person and of the family, and just. Here in the Vatican we have an extra reason to do so, we have the Gospel, and we must follow the guidelines of the Social Doctrine of the Church. Here in the Vatican I do not want there to be work that is out of line with this: no undeclared work, no subterfuge. Thus, let us all thank the Lord. However, for my part, today I want to thank you for your work. I thank each of you, each one, for the diligence you put forth each day in doing your work and trying to do it well, even when perhaps you don’t feel very well, or there are family concerns.... A good thing about the Vatican is that, being a very small entity, it is possible to perceive it as a whole, with the various tasks that form the whole, and each one is important. The various work sectors are close and connected, we know everyone somewhat; and we feel the satisfaction of seeing a certain order, that things function, with all the limitations, of course, we can and must always improve, but it is good to hear that every sector does its part and the whole functions well for the benefit of all. Here, this is easier, because we are a small entity, but this takes nothing away from the effort and personal merit; and for this I feel moved to thank you. This year we have lived a special year: it was the Holy Year of Mercy. We too celebrated our Jubilee together, do you remember? The first part here, in this Hall, and then we went together in procession to the Holy Door. This year the Lord poured out his mercy upon us. Did all this grace end with the conclusion of the Jubilee? No! This grace is within us, so that we may make it bear fruit in life each day, whether at home or at work, everywhere. Christmas reminds us of this: “For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all men, training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world” (Tit 2:11-12), so says Saint Paul the Apostle. The “grace of God” has “appeared” in Jesus, He is Love, the Love of God incarnate, by the power of the Holy Spirit. We have all received this same Spirit, in Baptism and in Confirmation; but we must invoke him each day, to reawaken the action of the Spirit in us, in order to “live in this world” — also in this little world of the Vatican — “sober, upright, and godly lives”. Dear brothers and sisters, as I thank you, I ask you to convey my special greeting to the children and the elderly members of your families. They are so important, each of them. And [convey] a greeting together with prayers to the sick. I offer this wish to all: that your hearts may be full of mercy, full of the Jubilee grace that Jesus comes to rekindle in us. May the Lord bless you and Our Lady protect you. And before the Nativity scene, remember to pray for me. Thank you.","pope":"Francis","type":"Speeche","year":2016}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf217733bdc0178ba0329"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Today is the Feast of the Holy Family of Nazareth. In the liturgy the passage from Luke’s Gospel presents to us the Virgin Mary and St Joseph. Faithful to the tradition, they go to Jerusalem for the Passover taking the 12-year-old Jesus with them. The first time that Jesus had entered the Temple of the Lord was 40 days after his birth, when his parents had offered on his behalf “a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons” (Lk 2:24) on his behalf, that is, the sacrifice offered by the poor. “Luke, whose entire Gospel is shot through with a theology of the poor and a theology of poverty, is once again making it abundantly clear that Jesus’ family belongs to the poor of Israel, and that it was among such as them that the promises would be fulfilled” (Jesus of Nazareth: The Infancy Narratives, p. 81). Today Jesus is once again in the Temple, but this time he has a different role, which involves him in the first person. He makes the pilgrimage, with Mary and Joseph, to Jerusalem as prescribed by the Law (cf. Ex 23:17, 34:23 ff) even though he was not yet in his thirteenth year: a sign of the Holy Family’s deep devotion. Yet, when his parents set out on their return to Nazareth, something unexpected happens. Without saying a word Jesus remains in the city. Mary and Joseph search for him for three days and find him in the Temple, conversing with the teachers of the Law (Lk 2: 46, 47); and when they ask him for an explanation, Jesus answers that they should not be surprised since this is his place, the house of his Father, who is God (The Infancy Narratives, p. 123). “He”, Origen writes, “professes to be in the temple of his Father, the Father who has revealed himself to us and whose Son he says he is” (Homilies on the Gospel of Luke, 18, 5). Mary and Joseph’s anxiety about Jesus is the same as that of every parent who educates a child, introduces him or her to life and to understanding reality. Today, therefore, it is only right to say a special prayer to the Lord for all the families of the world. Emulating the Holy Family of Nazareth, may parents be seriously concerned with the development and upbringing of their children so that they grow up to be responsible and honest citizens, never forgetting that faith is a precious gift to be nurtured in their children by their own example. At the same time let us pray that every child be welcomed as a gift of God and be supported by the love of both parents in order to increase, like the Lord Jesus “in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man” (Lk 2:52). May the love, loyalty and dedication of Mary and Joseph be an example to all Christian couples who are not the friends or masters of their children’s lives, but rather are custodians of this incomparable gift of God. The silence of Joseph, a just man (cf. Mt 1:19), and the example of Mary who kept all these things in her heart (cf. Lk 2:51), usher us into the mystery of the Holy Family, full of faith and humanity. I hope that all Christian families will live in God’s presence with the same love and the same joy as the family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Angelus","year":2012}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf252733bdc0178ba032a"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, After celebrating the Solemnity of All Saints, today the Church invites us to commemorate all the faithful departed, to turn our eyes to the many faces who have gone before us and who have ended their earthly journey. So at today’s Audience, I would like to offer a few simple thoughts on the reality of death, which for us Christians is illuminated by the Resurrection of Christ, and so as to renew our faith in eternal life. As I already said at the Angelus yesterday, during these days we go to the cemetery to pray for the loved ones who have left us, as it were paying a visit to show them, once more, our love, to feel them still close, remembering also, an article of the Creed: in the communion of saints there is a close bond between us who are still walking here upon the earth and those many brothers and sisters who have already entered eternity. Human beings have always cared for their dead and sought to give them a sort of second life through attention, care and affection. In a way, we want to preserve their experience of life; and, paradoxically, by looking at their graves, before which countless memories return, we discover how they lived, what they loved, what they feared, what they hoped for and what they hated. They are almost a mirror of their world. Why is this so? Because, despite the fact that death is an almost forbidden subject in our society and that there is a continuous attempt to banish the thought of it from our minds, death touches each of us, it touches mankind of every age and every place. And before this mystery we all, even unconsciously, search for something to give us hope, a sign that might bring us consolation, open up some horizon, offer us a future once more. The road to death, in reality, is a way of hope and it passes through our cemeteries, just as can be read on the tombstones and fulfills a journey marked by the hope of eternity. Yet, we wonder, why do we feel fear before death? Why has humanity, for the most part, never resigned itself to the belief that beyond life there is simply nothing? I would say that there are multiple answers: we are afraid of death because we are afraid of that nothingness, of leaving this world for something we don’t know, something unknown to us. And, then, there is a sense of rejection in us because we cannot accept that all that is beautiful and great, realized during a lifetime, should be suddenly erased, should fall into the abyss of nothingness. Above all, we feel that love calls and asks for eternity and it is impossible to accept that it is destroyed by death in an instant. Furthermore, we fear in the face of death because, when we find ourselves approaching the end of our lives, there is a perception that our actions will be judged, the way in which we have lived our lives, above all, those moments of darkness which we often skillfully remove or try to remove from our conscience. I would say that precisely the question of judgment often underlies man of all time’s concern for the dead, the attention paid to the people who were important to him and are no longer with him on the journey through earthly life. In a certain sense the gestures of affection and love which surround the deceased are a way to protect him in the conviction that they will have an effect on the judgment. This we can gather from the majority of cultures that characterize the history of man. Today the world has become, at least in appearance, much more rational, or rather, there is a more widespread tendency to think that every reality ought to be tackled with the criteria of experimental science, and that the great questions about death ought to be answered not so much with faith as with empirical, provable knowledge. It is not sufficiently taken into account, however, that precisely in this way one is doomed to fall into forms of spiritism, in an attempt to have some kind of contact with the world beyond, almost imagining it to be a reality that, ultimately, is a copy of the present one. Dear friends, the Solemnity of All Saints and the Commemoration of all the faithful departed tells us that only those who can recognize a great hope in death, can live a life based on hope. If we reduce man exclusively to his horizontal dimension, to that which can be perceived empirically, life itself loses its profound meaning. Man needs eternity for every other hope is too brief, too limited for him. Man can be explained only if there is a Love which overcomes every isolation, even that of death, in a totality which also transcends time and space. Man can be explained, he finds his deepest meaning, only if there is God. And we know that God left his distance for us and made himself close. He entered into our life and tells us: “I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die” (Jn 11:25-26). Let us think for a moment of the scene on Calvary and listen again to Jesus’ words from the height of the Cross, addressed to the criminal crucified on his right: “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise” (Lk 23:43). We think of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus, when, after traveling a stretch of the way with the Risen Jesus, they recognize him and set out immediately for Jerusalem to proclaim the Resurrection of the Lord (cf. Lk 24:13-35). The Master’s words come back to our minds with renewed clarity: “Let not your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms; if it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?” (Jn 14:1-2). God is truly demonstrated, he became accessible, for he so loved the world “that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life” (Jn 3:16), and in the supreme act of love on the Cross, immersing himself in the abyss of death, he conquered it, and rose and opened the doors of eternity for us too. Christ sustains us through the night of death which he himself overcame; he is the Good Shepherd, on whose guidance one can rely without any fear, for he knows the way well, even through darkness. Every Sunday in reciting the Creed, we reaffirm this truth. And in going to cemeteries to pray with affection and love for our departed, we are invited, once more, to renew with courage and with strength our faith in eternal life, indeed to live with this great hope and to bear witness to it in the world: behind the present there is not nothing. And faith in eternal life gives to Christians the courage to love our earth ever more intensely and to work in order to build a future for it, to give it a true and sure hope. Thank you.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Audience","year":2011}

The Consistory and yesterday's Eucharistic Celebration on the Solemnity of Christ the King have afforded us a special opportunity to experience the Church's catholicity, well represented by the variegated provenance of the members of the College of Cardinals gathered round the Successor of Peter in close communion. I am thus glad once again to address my cordial greeting to these new Cardinals and with them, I greet all of you, relatives and friends, who have come to gather round them at such an important moment in their lives. I greet you first, dear Italian Cardinals. I greet you, Cardinal Giovanni Lajolo, President of the Pontifical Commission and of the Governorate of Vatican City State; I greet you, Cardinal Angelo Comastri, Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica, my Vicar General for Vatican City State and President of the Fabric of St Peter; I greet you, Cardinal Raffaele Farina, Archivist and Librarian of Holy Roman Church; I greet you, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, Metropolitan Archbishop of Genoa and President of the Italian Bishops' Conference; I greet you, Cardinal Giovanni Coppa, former Apostolic Nuncio in the Czech Republic; I greet you, Cardinal Umberto Betti, former Rector of the Pontifical Lateran University. Venerable and dear Brothers, so many persons and friends, bound to you in various ways, are beside you on this occasion, which is at the same time both solemn and intimate. I urge each one of them never to let you lack friendship, esteem and prayers, thereby helping you to continue to serve the Church faithfully, and in the various tasks and ministries that Providence entrusts to you, to bear an ever more generous witness of love for Christ. I am pleased to greet the new members of the College of Cardinals. Cardinal André Vingt-Trois, Archbishop of Paris; Cardinal Théodore-Adrien Sarr, Archbishop of Dakar, as well as their loved ones and members of their Dioceses who have wished to accompany them on this happy occasion. May the ceremonies we have been able to experience in the past two days strengthen your faith and your love of Christ and the Church. I also ask you to support your Pastors and accompany them with your prayers, so that they may always guide the people entrusted to them with care. Let us also not forget to ask Christ for young people to be willing to accept a commitment to the priesthood. I extend a cordial greeting to the English-speaking Prelates whom I had the joy of raising to the dignity of Cardinal in last Saturday's Consistory. Cardinal John Patrick Foley, Grand Master of the Knights of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem; Cardinal Seán Baptist Brady, Archbishop of Armagh, Ireland; Cardinal Oswald Gracias, Archbishop of Bombay, India; Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, Archbishop of Galveston-Houston (U.S.A.); Cardinal John Njue, Archbishop of Nairobi (Kenya); Cardinal Emmanuel III Delly, Patriarch of Babylon for Chaldeans. I am also pleased to have this opportunity to welcome their family members and friends, and all the faithful who have accompanied them to Rome. The College of Cardinals, whose origin is linked to the ancient clergy of the Roman Church, is charged with electing the Successor of Peter and advising him in matters of greater importance. Whether in the offices of the Roman Curia or in their ministry in the local Churches throughout the world, the Cardinals are called to share in a special way in the Pope's solicitude for the universal Church. The vivid colour of their robes has traditionally been seen as a sign of their commitment to defending Christ's flock even to the shedding of their blood. As the new Cardinals accept the burden of this office, I am confident that they will be supported by your constant prayers and your cooperation in their efforts to build up the Body of Christ in unity, holiness and peace. I offer a warm welcome to Cardinal Paul Josef Cordes, to his family, his friends and his guests who have come from Germany, as well as the faithful from his Archdiocese of Paderborn, of which he was also Bishop. Together with you, I thank our new Cardinal for the precious service to the Successor of Peter that he has carried out for many years as President of the Pontifical Council \"Cor Unum\". Continue to accompany him with your prayers and support him in his important task of practical solicitude for the Pope's loving service to the poor and needy. May the Lord give his grace to you all! I warmly greet the new Spanish-speaking Cardinals, accompanied by their relatives and numerous Bishops, priests, Religious and lay people from Argentina, Spain and Mexico. Argentina rejoices for Cardinal Leonardo Sandri who, after serving the Holy See as Substitute of the Secretariat of State, is now in charge of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, and also for Cardinal Estanislao Esteban Karlic, Archbishop emeritus of Paraná, who has served that Ecclesial Community for so many years with affection and self-denial. The Church in Spain rejoices for Cardinal Agustín García-Gasco Vicente, Archbishop of Valencia, a city I visited last year for the World Day of the Family; for Cardinal Lluís Martínez Sistach, Archbishop of Barcelona, who formerly carried out a fruitful ministry in Tortosa and Tarragona; and also for Cardinal Urbano Navarrete, former Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, who devoted his life to studying and teaching Canon Law. The pilgrim Church in Mexico congratulates Cardinal Francisco Robles Ortega, Archbishop of Monterrey, whose constant pastoral dedication was also manifest in Toluca. Let us turn our minds to the Virgin Mary, to whom your peoples are so devoted, and ask her to intercede for these Cardinals with her divine Son in order to enrich their service to the Church with an abundance of fruit. I greet Cardinal Odilo Pedro Scherer and the Bishops who have desired to accompany him together with his family, friends and guests. I find this a favourable opportunity to recall the days of my Pastoral Visit to São Paulo this year and to renew my gratitude for the welcome I received in his Archdiocese. I express the wish that his appointment as Cardinal may help deepen his love for the Church and strengthen the faith of his faithful in Jesus Christ, our Saviour and Lord! I greet Cardinal Stanisław Ryłko and his guests. I thank him for all that he does for the participation of lay people in the life of the Church and I wish him abundant graces. I commend you all to the love of God and I cordially bless you. Lastly, I renew my brotherly greeting to you, venerable and dear new Cardinals, and as I assure you of my prayers, I ask you to accompany me always with your appreciated human and pastoral experience. I set great store by your invaluable support to enable me to carry out as well as possible my ministry at the service of the entire People of God. I am in need of this support. And to you, dear brothers and sisters who gather round them with affection, once again, thank you for your participation in the various rites and moments of the Consistory. Continue to pray for them and also for me that the communion of the Pastors with the Pope may always be firm, so as to offer the whole world the witness of a Church faithful to Christ and ready to respond with prophetic courage to the spiritual expectations and needs of the people of our time. On your return to your various Dioceses, I ask you to convey to everyone my greeting and the assurance of my constant remembrance with the Lord. I invoke upon you, dear new Cardinals, and upon all of you who are present here, the protection of the Heavenly Mother of God and of the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul. With these sentiments, I cordially impart my Apostolic Blessing to you all.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Speech","year":2007}

To this place, so dear to the Christian community, my venerable predecessors the Servants of God Paul VI and John Paul II came as pilgrims; the latter visited this Shrine on 30 November 1979, just over a year after the beginning of his Pontificate. Another of my Predecessors was in this country not as Pope, but as the Papal Representative, from January 1935 to December 1944, Blessed John XXIII, Angelo Roncalli, whose memory still enkindles great devotion and affection. He very much esteemed and admired the Turkish people. Here I would like to quote an entry in his Journal of a Soul: “I love the Turks; I appreciate the natural qualities of these people who have their own place reserved in the march of civilization” (pp. 233-4). He also left to the Church and the world the legacy of his Christian optimism, rooted in deep faith and constant union with God. In that same spirit, I turn to this nation and, in a special way, to the “little flock” of Christ living in its midst, in order to offer a word of encouragement and to manifest the affection of the whole Church. With great love I greet all of you here present, the faithful of Izmir, Mersin, Iskenderun and Antakia, and others from different parts of the world, as well as those who could not take part in this celebration but are spiritually united with us. I greet in particular Archbishop Ruggero Franceschini of Izmir, Archbishop Giuseppe Bernardini, Archbishop emeritus of Izmir, Bishop Luigi Padovese, the priests and the religious. Thank you for your presence, your witness and your service to the Church in this blessed land where, at its very beginnings, the Christian community experienced great growth, a fact reflected in the numerous pilgrimages made to Turkey to this day. Mother of God – Mother of the Church We have listened to a passage from Saint John’s Gospel which invites us to contemplate the moment of the Redemption when Mary, united to her Son in the offering of his sacrifice, extended her motherhood to all men and women, and in particular to the disciples of Jesus. A privileged witness to that event was the author of the Fourth Gospel, John, the only one of the Apostles to remain at Golgotha with the Mother of Jesus and the other women. Mary’s motherhood, which began with her fiat in Nazareth, is fulfilled at the foot of the Cross. Although it is true – as Saint Anselm says – that “from the moment of her fiat Mary began to carry all of us in her womb”, the maternal vocation and mission of the Virgin towards those who believe in Christ actually began when Jesus said to her: “Woman, behold your son!” (Jn 19:26). Looking down from the Cross at his Mother and the beloved disciple by her side, the dying Christ recognized the firstfruits of the family which he had come to form in the world, the beginning of the Church and the new humanity. For this reason, he addressed Mary as “Woman”, not as “Mother”, the term which he was to use in entrusting her to his disciple: “Behold your Mother!” (Jn 19:27). The Son of God thus fulfilled his mission: born of the Virgin in order to share our human condition in everything but sin, at his return to the Father he left behind in the world the sacrament of the unity of the human race (cf. Lumen Gentium, 1): the family “brought into unity from the unity of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit” (Saint Cyprian, De Orat. Dom., 23: PL 4, 536), at whose heart is this new bond between the Mother and the disciple. Mary’s divine motherhood and her ecclesial motherhood are thus inseparably united. Mother of God – Mother of Unity The first reading presented what could be called the “Gospel” of the Apostle of the Gentiles: all men and women, including the pagans, are called in Christ to share fully in the mystery of salvation. The text also contains the expression that I have chosen as the motto for my Apostolic Journey: “He, Christ, is our peace” (Eph 2:14). Inspired by the Holy Spirit, Paul tells us that Jesus Christ has not only brought us peace, but that he is our peace. And he justifies this statement by referring to the mystery of the Cross: by shedding “his blood”, by offering in sacrifice “his flesh”, Jesus destroyed hostility “in himself” and created “in himself one new man in place of the two” (Eph 2:14-16). The Apostle explains how, in a truly unforeseen way, messianic peace has now come about in Christ’s own person and his saving mystery. He explains it by writing, during his imprisonment, to the Christian community which lived here, in Ephesus: “to the saints who are in Ephesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus” (Eph 1:1), as he says in the salutation of the Letter. The Apostle wishes them “grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (Eph 1:2). Grace is the power that transforms man and the world; peace is the mature fruit of this transformation. Christ is grace; Christ is peace. Paul knows that he has been sent to proclaim a “mystery”, a divine plan that only in the fullness of time has been carried out and revealed in Christ: namely, that “the Gentiles have become fellow heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the Gospel” (Eph 3:6). This mystery is accomplished, in salvation history, in the Church, the new People in which, now that the old dividing wall has been broken down, Jews and pagans find themselves united. Like Christ himself, the Church is not only the instrument of unity, but also its efficacious sign. And the Virgin Mary, the Mother of Christ and of the Church, is the Mother of that mystery of unity which Christ and the Church inseparably signify and build up, in the world and throughout history. Let us implore peace for Jerusalem and the whole world The Apostle of the Gentiles says that Christ “has made us both one” (Eph 2:14): these words properly refer to the relationship between Jews and Gentiles in the mystery of eternal salvation, yet they can also extend, by analogy, to the relationship between the peoples and civilizations present in the world. Christ “came to proclaim peace” (Eph 2:17), not only between Jews and non-Jews, but between all nations, since all have their origin in the same God, the one Creator and Lord of the universe. Strengthened by God’s word, from here in Ephesus, a city blessed by the presence of Mary Most Holy – who we know is loved and venerated also by Muslims – let us lift up to the Lord a special prayer for peace between peoples. From this edge of the Anatolian peninsula, a natural bridge between continents, let us implore peace and reconciliation, above all for those dwelling in the Land called “Holy” and considered as such by Christians, Jews and Muslims alike: it is the land of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, destined to be the home of a people that would become a blessing for all the nations (cf. Gen 12:1-3). Peace for all of humanity! May Isaiah’s prophecy soon be fulfilled: “They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more” (Is 2:4). We all need this universal peace; and the Church is called to be not only the prophetic herald, but even more, the “sign and instrument” of this peace. Against the backdrop of universal peace, the yearning for full communion and concord between all Christians becomes even more profound and intense. Present at today’s celebration are Catholic faithful of various rites, and this is a reason for joyful praise of God. These rites, when they converge in unity and common witness, are an expression of that marvellous variety which adorns the Bride of Christ. In this regard, the unity of the Ordinaries of the Episcopal Conference in fellowship and the sharing of pastoral efforts must set an example. Magnificat In today’s liturgy we have repeated, as the refrain of the Responsorial Psalm, the song of praise proclaimed by the Virgin of Nazareth on meeting her elderly kinswoman Elizabeth (cf. Lk 1:39). Our hearts too were consoled by the words of the Psalmist: “steadfast love and faithfulness will meet, righteousness and peace will kiss” (Ps 85:10). Dear brothers and sisters, in this visit I have wanted to convey my personal love and spiritual closeness, together with that of the universal Church, to the Christian community here in Turkey, a small minority which faces many challenges and difficulties daily. With firm trust let us sing, together with Mary, a magnificat of praise and thanksgiving to God who has looked with favour upon the lowliness of his servant (cf. Lk 1:48). Let us sing joyfully, even when we are tested by difficulties and dangers, as we have learned from the fine witness given by the Roman priest Don Andrea Santoro, whom I am pleased to recall in this celebration. Mary teaches us that the source of our joy and our one sure support is Christ, and she repeats his words: “Do not be afraid” (Mk 6:50), “I am with you” (Mt 28:20). Mary, Mother of the Church, accompany us always on our way! Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us! Aziz Meryem Mesih’in Annesi bizim için Dua et. Amen.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Homilie","year":2006}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf400733bdc0178ba032e"},"text":"1. At this time of the final preparation for the Christmas celebrations, the liturgy presents to us repeatedly the invocation \"Come, Lord Jesus\". It is like a refrain that wells up from the hearts of believers in every corner of the earth and ceaselessly echoes in the prayer of the Church. We have also just invoked the coming of Christ as we sang today's \"O\" Antiphon. In it the Messiah is called by titles taken from the biblical tradition that are especially beautiful and meaningful: \"King of nations\" and the \"Desired\" of all nations, the \"Cornerstone who makes all one\". 2. At Christmas, we will contemplate the great mystery of God made man in the Virgin Mary's womb. He was born in Bethlehem to share our frail human condition! He comes to dwell among us and brings salvation to the whole world. His mission will be to gather individuals and peoples into the one family of God's children. We can say that in the Mystery of Christmas we are granted to contemplate a \"qualitative leap\" in the history of salvation. Man who through sin distanced himself from the Creator is now offered the gift of new and full communion with him. Thus, hope is rekindled in his heart, while the gates of paradise are re-opened to humanity. 3. Dear brothers and sisters, the celebration of Christmas, now at hand, is a favourable opportunity for everyone to live more deeply the value and significance of the great event of Jesus' birth. This is my hope for all of you who are taking part in this General Audience, for your families and for the Communities from which you come. ","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Audience","year":2004}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf53b733bdc0178ba032f"},"text":"1. \"The Spirit and the Bride say \"Come'. And let him who hears say, \"Come'. And let him who is thirsty come, let him who desires take the water of life without price\" (Apoc 22: 17). These words from the Apocalypse echo in my heart as I remember that 40 years ago today, exactly on 4 December 1963, my venerable Predecessor, Pope Paul VI, promulgated the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium on the Sacred Liturgy. What, indeed, is the Liturgy other than the voice of the Holy Spirit and of the Bride, holy Church, crying in unison to the Lord Jesus: \"Come\"? What is the Liturgy other than that pure, inexhaustible source of \"living water\" from which all who thirst can freely draw the gift of God (cf. Jn 4: 10)? Indeed, in the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, the first fruit of the Second Vatican Council, that \"great grace bestowed on the Church in the 20th century\"1, the Holy Spirit spoke to the Church, ceaselessly guiding the disciples of the Lord \"into all the truth\" (Jn 16: 13). The commemoration of the 40th anniversary of this event is a good opportunity to rediscover the basic themes of the liturgical renewal that the Council Fathers desired, to seek to evaluate their reception, as it were, and to cast a glance at the future. 2. With the passing of time and in the light of its fruits, the importance of Sacrosanctum Concilium has become increasingly clear. The Council brilliantly outlined in it the principles on which are based the liturgical practices of the Church and which inspire its healthy renewal in the course of time2. The Council Fathers set the Liturgy within the horizon of the history of salvation, whose purpose is the redemption of humanity and the perfect glorification of God. The wonders wrought by God in the Old Testament were but a prelude to the redemption brought to completion by Christ the Lord, especially through the Paschal Mystery of his blessed Passion, his Resurrection from the dead and his glorious Ascension3. However, it needs not only to be proclaimed but also to be accomplished; this \"is set in train through the sacrifice and sacraments, around which the entire liturgical life revolves\"4. Christ makes himself present in a special way in the liturgical gestures associating the Church with himself. Every liturgical celebration, therefore, is the work of Christ the Priest and of his Mystical Body, \"full public worship\"5 in which the faithful take part, with a foretaste in it of the Liturgy of the heavenly Jerusalem6. This is why the \"Liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is directed\" and at the same time, \"the fount from which all her power flows\"7. 3. The liturgical outlook of the Council did not keep to interchurch relations, but was open to the horizons of all humanity. Indeed, in his praise to the Father, Christ attaches to himself the whole community of men and women. He does so specifically through the mission of a praying Church which, \"by celebrating the Eucharist and by other means, especially the celebration of the Divine Office, is ceaselessly engaged in praising the Lord and interceding for the salvation of the entire world\"8. In the perspective of Sacrosanctum Concilium, the liturgical life of the Church acquires a cosmic and universal scope that makes a deep mark on human time and space. It is also possible to understand in this perspective the renewed attention that the Constitution pays to the liturgical year through which the Church journeys, commemorating and reliving the Paschal Mystery of Christ9. If the Liturgy consists in all of this, the Council rightly affirms that every liturgical action \"is a sacred action surpassing all others. No other action of the Church can equal its efficacy by the same title and to the same degree\"10. At the same time, the Council recognizes that \"the Sacred Liturgy does not exhaust the entire activity of the Church\"11. Indeed, on the one hand the Liturgy presupposes the proclamation of the Gospel, and on the other, it demands a Christian witness in history. The mystery proposed in preaching and catechesis, listened to with faith and celebrated in the Liturgy, must shape the entire life of believers who are called to be its heralds in the world12. 4. Then with regard to the different elements involved in liturgical celebration, the Constitution pays special attention to the importance of sacred music. The Council praises it, pointing out as its objective: \"the glory of God and the sanctification of the faithful\"13. In fact, sacred music is a privileged means to facilitate the active participation of the faithful in sacred celebration, as my venerable Predecessor St Pius X desired to highlight in his Motu Proprio On the Restoration of Sacred Music Tra le Sollecitudini, whose centenary occurs this year. It was this very anniversary that recently gave me an opportunity to reassert the need to preserve and to emphasize the role of music at liturgical celebrations, in accordance with the directives of Sacrosanctum Concilium14 and mindful of the Liturgy's real character as well as the sensibility of our time and the musical traditions of the world's different regions. 5. Sacred art was another fruitful topic addressed by the conciliar Constitution. It gave rise to many developments. The Council gives clear instructions to continue to leave considerable room for it in our day too, so that the splendour of worship will shine out through the fittingness and beauty of liturgical art. To this end it will be appropriate to make provision for projects to train the various craftsmen and artists who are commissioned to build and decorate places destined for liturgical use15. At the root of these guidelines is a vision of art, and sacred art in particular, that relates it to \"the infinite beauty of God in works made by human hands\"16. From renewal to deepening 6. Forty years later, it is appropriate to review the ground covered. I have already suggested on former occasions a sort of examination of conscience concerning the reception given to the Second Vatican Council17. Such an examination must also concern the liturgical and sacramental life. \"Is the Liturgy lived as the \"origin and summit' of ecclesial life, in accordance with the teaching of Sacrosanctum Concilium?\"18. Has the rediscovery of the value of the Word of God brought about by liturgical reform met with a positive confirmation in our celebrations? To what extent does the Liturgy affect the practice of the faithful and does it mark the rhythm of the individual communities? Is it seen as a path of holiness, an inner force of apostolic dynamism and of the Church's missionary outreach? 7. The Council's renewal of the Liturgy is expressed most clearly in the publication of liturgical books. After a preliminary period in which the renewed texts were little by little incorporated into the liturgical celebrations, a deeper knowledge of their riches and potential has become essential. The mainspring of this deepening must be a principle of total fidelity to the Sacred Scriptures and to Tradition, authoritatively interpreted in particular by the Second Vatican Council, whose teachings have been reasserted and developed in the ensuing Magisterium. This fidelity engages in the first place the Bishop \"to whom is committed the office of offering the worship of Christian religion to the divine Majesty and of administering it in accordance with the Lord's commandments and with the Church's laws\"19; at the same time, it involves the entire ecclesial community \"in different ways, depending on their orders, their role in the liturgical services and their actual participation in them\"20. In this perspective, it is more necessary than ever to intensify liturgical life within our communities by means of an appropriate formation of the pastors and of all the faithful with a view to the active, conscious and full participation in liturgical celebrations desired by the Council21. 8. Consequently, what is needed is a pastoral care of the Liturgy that is totally faithful to the new ordines. Through these, renewed interest in the Word of God has gradually developed as the Council desired, hoping for a return to a \"more ample, more varied and more suitable reading from Sacred Scripture\"22. The new lectionaries, for example, offer a broad choice of passages from Scripture which constitute an inexhaustible source from which the People of God can and must draw. Indeed, we cannot forget that \"in listening to the Word of God the Church grows and is built, and the wonderful works God once wrought in many different ways in the history of salvation are represented in their mystical truth through the signs of the liturgical celebration\"23. In this celebration, the Word of God expresses the fullness of their meaning, inciting Christian life to continuous renewal, so that \"what is heard at the liturgical celebration may also be put into practice in life\"24. 9. Sunday, the Lord's Day, on which the Resurrection of Christ is especially commemorated, is at the heart of liturgical life as the \"foundation and nucleus of the whole liturgical year\"25. There is no doubt that considerable pastoral effort has been expended to bring people to rediscover the value of Sunday. Yet it is essential to make a point of this, for \"the spiritual and pastoral riches of Sunday, as it has been handed on to us by tradition, are truly great. When its significance and implications are understood in their entirety, Sunday in a way becomes a synthesis of the Christian life and a condition for living it well\"26. 10. Liturgical celebration nourishes the spiritual life of the faithful.

{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf5b0733bdc0178ba0330"},"text":"To Mons. Francesco Follo Permanent Observer of the Holy See at UNESCO 1. The 50th anniversary of the Permanent Mission of the Holy See at UNESCO enjoys a special importance, and I am happy to join in spirit and cordially greet all the participants in the colloquium called to observe this event. On this occasion, I am pleased to recall the illustrious memory of your predecessor, Mons. Angelo Roncalli, Blessed Pope John, who was the first Permanent Observer of this Mission of the Holy See. 2. Created in the 20th century immediately after the Second World War, the United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO) was born of the desire of the nations to live in peace, justice and freedom, and to provide one another with the means to promote this peace actively through a new international cooperation, marked by a spirit of mutual assistance and founded on the intellectual and moral solidarity of humanity. It was natural for the Catholic Church to be associated with this great project because of the unique sovereignty of the Holy See, but, as I said to this assembly in 1980, also and especially, by reason of the \"organic and constitutive link which exists between religion in general and Christianity in particular, on the one hand, and culture, on the other\" (Address to UNESCO, 2 June 1980, n. 9; ORE, 23 June 1980, p. 10). 3. The intuitions that prevailed at the foundation of UNESCO more than 50 years ago, stressed the importance of education for peace and solidarity, not losing sight of the fact that \"if wars are born in people's minds, it is in the human spirit that the defences of peace must be built\" (Constitution of UNESCO, 16 November 1945). Today these intuitions have been fully confirmed. The phenomenon of globalization has become a reality defining economics, politics and culture, bringing with it positive and negative values. They are areas that offer a challenge to our sense of responsibility so that a truly worldwide solidarity can be organized that alone can give our earth a secure future and lasting peace. In the name of the mission she has from her Founder to be the universal sacrament of salvation, without ignoring any situation, the Church never ceases to speak and act in favour of justice and peace, inviting nations to dialogue and understanding. Thus she bears witness to the truth she has received about man, his origin, his nature and his destiny. She knows that this search for the truth is the person's innermost pursuit and that it is not defined by what he possesses but by what he is, by the capacity to surpass self and to mature in humanity. The Church also knows that, by inviting our contemporaries to seek the truth about themselves with burning rigour, she calls them to their true freedom, while other voices, enticing them to take an easier path, contribute to enslave them to the renewed fascination and power of today's idols. 4. The Catholic Church, in her mission to all the peoples of the earth, is not identified with any race, nation, or culture. In the course of her history, she has always used the resources of many cultures to make known to humanity the Good News of Christ because she is fully conscious that the faith that she proclaims can never be reduced to one cultural element, but is the source of salvation for the whole human person and his activity. However, it is through the diversity and multiplicity of languages, cultures, traditions and mentalities, that the Church expresses her catholicity, unity, and faith. She does her best to respect every human culture, because in her missionary and pastoral activity she follows the rule that \"whatever good is found sown in the minds and hearts of men or in the rites and customs of peoples, these not only are preserved from destruction, but are purified, raised up, and perfected for the glory of God, the confusion of the devil and the happiness of man\" (Lumen gentium, n. 17). For these reasons, the Catholic Church holds in high esteem the nation, since it is the forge in which the sense of the common good is created, where one learns what it means to belong to a culture, through language, the transmission of family values and formation in the common memory. Similarly, the multiform experience of human cultures that she possesses because she is \"catholic\", that is, universal in both space and time, makes her desire to help people abandon an excessive particularity and narrow and exclusive nationalism. We should keep in mind that \"every culture, as a typically human and historically conditioned reality, necessarily has its limitations\" (Message for the World Day of Peace, 1 January 2001, 8 December 2000, n. 7; ORE, 20/27 December 2000, p. 10). Thus, \"in order to prevent the sense of belonging to one particular culture from turning into isolation, an effective antidote is a serene and unprejudiced knowledge of other cultures\" (ibid. n. 7). It is precisely the noble mission of UNESCO to foster such reciprocal knowledge of cultures and to encourage their institutional dialogue by all sorts of projects at the international level, namely, meetings, exchanges, formation programmes. Building bridges beween human beings, and, even sometimes rebuilding them when the folly of war has worked to destroy them, is a long-term, never finished project that entails the formation of consciences, the education of youth and the change of mentalities. This is a major opportunity for a globalization that will not produce a homogenization of values or reduce everything to the laws of the global market, but rather bring about the possibility of pooling the legitimate treasures of each nation in order to serve the good of all. 5. For her part, the Catholic Church rejoices in what has been done, even if she knows its limitations, and she continually encourages the peaceful encounter of human beings through their cultures and the consideration of the religious and spiritual dimension of individuals, which is part of their history. This really is the reason for the presence of the Permanent Observer of the Holy See at the United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture, who for 50 years has been a vigilant witness to the catholic nature of the Church and to her resolute dedication to the service of the human community. May the observance of this anniversary strengthen everyone's dedication to work tirelessly to serve true dialogue among the peoples through their cultures, so that everyone may be more conscious of belonging to the same human family and peace in the world may be better guaranteed! To you and to those taking part in the colloquium, I cordially grant a special Apostolic Blessing.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":2002}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf613733bdc0178ba0331"},"text":"Dear Volunteers! 1. At the end of the year, that the United Nations dedicated to Volunteer work, I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation for your constant dedication, in every part of the world, in going to meet those who live in poverty. Whether you work individually or gathered together in special associations, you represent for children, the elderly, the sick, people in difficulty, refugees and the persecuted a ray of hope that pierces the darkness of solitude and encourages them to overcome the temptations of violence and egotism. What makes a volunteer dedicate his/her life to others? First of all, the innate movement of the heart that inspires every human being to help his fellow man. It is a law of existence. A volunteer experiences a joy that goes far beyond what he has done when he succeeds in giving himself freely to others. For this reason, volunteer work is a special factor that contributes to humanization. Thanks to the many forms of solidarity and of service that they promote and make concrete, volunteer workers make society more attentive to the dignity of the human person and his/her many expectations. Through their activity, volunteers come to realize that, only if one loves and gives himself to others, does the human creature reach perfect fulfillment. 2. Christ, the Son of God made man, communicates to us the profound reason for this universal human experience. Revealing the face of God who is love (cf. I Jn 4,8), He reveals to the human person that love is the supreme law of his being. In his earthly life Jesus made the divine tenderness visible, emptying \"himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men\" (Phil 2,7) and \"gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God\" (Eph 5,1). Sharing our earthly life unto death, he has taught us \"to walk in charity\". Following in his footsteps in these two millennia, the Church has not ceased witnessing to this love, leaving an exemplary record thanks to the saints who left their mark on history. Among the more recent ones, I am thinking of St Maximilian Kolbe, who sacrificed himself to save the father of a family, and Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who consecrated herself to the poorest of the poor. Through love of God and love of the brethren, Christianity releases all of its liberating and salvific power. Charity represents the most eloquent form of evangelization because, responding to corporal needs, it reveals to men God's provident and fatherly love, concerned for each one. It is not a matter of satisfying only the material needs of our neighbour like hunger, thirst, lack of housing, medical care, but to lead him to a personal experience of the charity of God. Through volunteer work, the Christian becomes a witness of this divine charity; he proclaims it and makes it tangible with courageous and prophetic contributions. 3. It is not enough to help whoever is in material difficulty; it is necessary at the same time to respond to his thirst for values and personal spiritual solutions. The kind of help we offer is important, but more important than the kind of help offered is the heart of the one who gives it. Whether dealing with microprojects or great initiatives, in any event, volunteer work is called to be a school of life, especially for young people, contributing to educate them in a culture of solidarity and outreach, open to the free gift of self. How many volunteers through courageous commitment to their neighbour come to discover the faith! Christ, who asks to be served in the poor, speaks to the heart of the one who places himself at their service. He makes them experience the joy of disinterested love, that is the fountain of true happiness. I warmly hope that the International Year of Volunteers, the occasion for organizing many initiatives and events, may help society to promote the many forms of volunteer work that are the sign of growth in social awareness. Often, volunteers fill gaps and anticipate the presence of public institutions that must give due recognition to the works born of their courageous initiative and foster them without losing the originating spirit. 4. Dear Brothers and Sisters, who make up this \"army\" of peace spread over the face of the earth, you are a sign of hope for our times. Wherever situations of hardship and suffering appear, make bear fruit the hidden resources of dedication, goodness and heroism in the heart of the human person. Making myself the spokesman for the poor everywhere, I want to say \"thank you' for your steadfast dedication. Continue your journey with courage; do not let difficulties ever stop you. May Christ, the Good Samaritan (cf. Lk 10,30-37), be the sublime model to be imitated by every volunteer. Imitate Mary, who going \"in haste\" to assist her cousin Elizabeth, became a messenger of joy and salvation (cf. Lk 1,39-45). May she teach you her humble and concrete charity and obtain from the Lord the grace for you to recognize him in the poor and suffering. With these wishes, I impart a special Apostolic Blessing to you, and all whom you meet every day in the course of your service to the human person.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":2001}

All Catholics of Chinese origin are close to my heart as Pastor of the universal Church, but at this time I urgently wish to address in a special way the Shepherds and faithful of mainland China, who cannot as yet show forth, in a full and visible way, their communion with this Apostolic See. 1. Brothers and sisters of the Church in China, together with the faithful throughout the world who are preparing to celebrate the Great Jubilee and the beginning of a new Millennium, you have responded to the invitation of the Successor of Peter and the Bishop of Rome and you are approaching this event in faith. The practical suggestions which I made in the Bull of Indiction Incarnationis Mysterium, and the provisions for gaining the Jubilee Indulgence laid down in the Decree of the Apostolic Penitentiary, will be for all Catholics the norm and guide for a fruitful celebration of this providential year of grace, not only in Rome and the Holy Land, but throughout the Church. For very many Catholics around the world it will not be possible to pass through the Holy Door in Rome and to venerate the Tombs of the Apostles Peter and Paul. Nevertheless, wherever they live, all are invited to realize that “to pass through that door means to confess that Jesus is Lord; it is to strengthen faith in him in order to live the new life which he has given us. It is a decision which presumes freedom to choose, and also the courage to leave something behind, in the knowledge that what is gained is divine life (cf. Mt 13:44-46)” (Bull of Indiction, Incarnationis Mysterium, 8). 2. Our hearts turn back to the moment in history when, in “the fullness of time” (Gal 4:4), the Son of God was born among us: an event which most of mankind has now accepted as the point fo reference for the measurement of time and history. The birth of Jesus took place in a province of Palestine, an Asian land at the crossroads of the great cultural exchanges of East and West, a point where Asia, Europe and Africa meet. This birth was, and still is today, a source of joy for all people in “the vast span under heaven”, exactly as the Angel announced to the shepherds at Bethlehem: “I bring you news of a great joy which will come to all the people: for to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord” (Lk 2:10-11). The name given to the newborn child – Jesus, “God gives salvation”– is a synthesis of his mission and a promise for the whole human race: “God desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth” (1 Tim 2:4); “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life” (Jn 3:16). 3. During his lifetime, Jesus began to accomplish what was said of him at his birth: “To the poor he proclaimed the good news of salvation, to prisoners freedom and those in sorrow joy” (Fourth Eucharistic Prayer). To carry out God’s merciful and mysterious plan for the salvation of men and women, “he gave himself up to death, but by rising from the dead he destroyed death and restored life” (ibid). Before his Ascension and his return to the Father, he commanded his disciples, and in them the infant Church: “Go therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Mt 28:19). Obedient to the Lord and under the impulse of the Holy Spirit, the disciples carried out Jesus’ command, bringing the Good News to East and West, North and South. 4. The Jubilee not only recalls Jesus’ entry into history, but also his expanding presence among the peoples of the earth. As you well know, dear brothers and sisters, in accordance with the mysterious plans of divine Providence the Gospel of salvation soon reached your own country: as early as the fifth and sixth centuries groups of Syrian monks crossed Central Asia and brought the name of Jesus to your forebears. Even today, a famous stele in the capital Chang’an (Xi’an) powerfully evokes that moment in history, from 635 onwards, which saw the official entrance into China of “the Religion of light”. Some centuries later, that proclamation waned. But the fact that the Gospel of Jesus was preached to your ancestors at a time when much of Europe and the rest of the world had not yet heard it, should surely fill you with gratitude to God and intense joy. 5. The Gospel message, proclaimed in those distant beginnings, has lost none of its relevance, and it invites and impels you to make it known to those who have not yet received it. The life of Jesus’ disciples, then as now, in China as elsewhere, must be inspired by the “Good News”, and the genuine living of the Gospel in your lives will be a shining witness borne to Christ in your surroundings. For this reason all of you, dear brothers and sisters, are called to proclaim the Gospel of salvation to the Chinese people of today with new vigour. I realize that you feel unequal to such a great and demanding mission, but you know that you can count on the victorious power of Christ (cf. Jn 16:33), who promises you his presence and help. Led by your Pastors and in communion with them, you, dear priests, religious men and women, and lay people, will develop updated pastoral plans, placing primary emphasis on all that relates to the proclamation of Jesus and his word of life, and giving special attention to young people. In this context, the celebration of the Jubilee will be an occasion for remembering the apostolic labours, the sufferings, the tears and the shedding of blood which have been part of the Church’s journey among the people of every time. In your midst, too, the blood of your martyrs has become the seed of a multitude of authentic disciples of Jesus. My heart overflows with wonder and gratitude to God for the generous witness given by a host of Bishops, priests, men and women religious, and lay people. And it seems that the time of trial, in some places, has not yet come to an end! 6. In your preparation for the Great Jubilee, remember that in the Biblical tradition this moment always entailed the obligation to forgive one another’s debts, to make satisfaction for injustices committed, and to be reconciled with one’s neighbour. You too have heard the proclamation of the “great joy prepared for all peoples”: the love and mercy of the Father, the Redemption accomplished in Christ. To the extent that you yourselves are ready to accept this joyful proclamation, you will be able to pass it on, by your lives, to the men and women around you. My ardent desire is that you will respond to the interior promptings of the Holy Spirit by forgiving one another whatever needs to be forgiven, by drawing closer to one another, by accepting one another and by breaking down all barriers in order to overcome every possible cause of division. Do not forget the words of Jesus at the Last Supper: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another” (Jn 13:35). I rejoiced when I learned that you intend your most precious gift on the occasion of the Great Jubilee to be unity among yourselves and unity with the Successor of Peter. This intention can only be a fruit of the Spirit who guides the Church along the arduous paths of reconciliation and unity. 7. “One sign of the mercy of God which is especially necessary today is the sign of charity, which opens our eyes to the needs of those who are poor and excluded” (Bull of Indiction Incarnationis Mysterium, 12). The practical commitments that will evidence your striving for spiritual conversion and renewal must include charity towards your brothers and sisters in the traditional form of the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. This concrete solidarity will also be your quiet but effective contribution to the good of your People. Thus you will give eloquent testimony to the name of Christian which you bear with courage and pride: as good Chinese and authentic Christians, you love your country and you love the Church, both local and universal. 8. The Jubilee of the Year 2000 will be a great prayer of praise and thanksgiving above all for the gift of the Incarnation of the Son of God and the Redemption which he has accomplished. It will be praise and thanksgiving for the gift of the Church, founded by Christ as “a sacrament or sign of intimate union with God, and of the unity of all mankind” (Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Lumen Gentium, 1). This thanksgiving “will embrace the fruits of holiness which have matured in the life of all those many men and women” — including those from your own People — “who in every generation and every period of history have fully welcomed the gift of Redemption” (Tertio Millennio Adveniente, 32). 9. United among yourselves in the truth and charity of Christ, in communion with the universal Church and with him who has been called by Jesus to be the Successor of Peter and the pledge of unity, cross the threshold of the new Millennium, confident that the one God and Father of the whole human race will continue to bless your steps and those of all your People. Be a leaven of good for your People, despite your small numbers! Be a sign and a sacrament of the salvation promised by God to all men and women, and invite your neighbours to hear and to believe the good news of the Great Jubilee: “To you is born a Saviour!” May Mary, Mother of the Redeemer, Help of Christians and Queen of China, protect you and sustain you as you fulfil your vocation and strive, with ever more intent and generous hearts, to put these resolutions into practice. 10. At this point, my vision broadens to embrace, together with you, all the Chinese Catholics living outside of mainland China. To them goes my affectionate greeting along with my sincere hope that, during the Jubilee Year, they will be reassured “in the knowledge that they bring to the world the true light, Christ the Lord” (Bull of Indiction Incarnationis Mysterium, 2). They themselves will be a light and a leaven wherever Providence has placed them, and they will foster union of spirit with all their brothers and sisters of the great Chinese family. “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.” With these sentiments I send all of you my heartfelt blessing!","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":1999}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf713733bdc0178ba0333"},"text":"Dear Young People of Cuba, 1. \"Jesus, looking upon him, loved him\" (Mk 10:21). This is how the Gospel describes the meeting between Jesus and the rich young man. And this is how the Lord looks upon each of us. His eyes, full of affection, are fixed today on the young people of Cuba. And I, in his name, embrace you, for I see in you the living hope of the Church and of Cuba. I want to pass on to you the heartfelt greetings and genuine affection of all the young Christians of the different countries and continents which I have been able to visit in the exercise of my ministry as the Successor of Peter. Like you, they are moving towards the future amid joys and hopes, sorrows and anxieties, as the Second Vatican Council puts it. I have come to Cuba as a messenger of truth and life, to bring you the Good News, to proclaim to you \"the love of God made known in Christ Jesus our Lord\" (Rom 8:39). This love alone can light up the night of human loneliness; this love alone can strengthen the hope of all who search for happiness. Christ has told us that \"no one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what I command you.... I have called you friends\" (Jn 15:13-15). Christ offers you his friendship. He gave his life so that those who wish to answer his call can indeed become his friends. His is a friendship which is deep, genuine, loyal and total, as all true friendship must be. This is how young people ought to relate to one other, for youth without friendship is impoverished and diminished. Friendship is nourished by sacrifice for the sake of serving one's friends and truly loving them. And without such sacrifice there can be no real friendship, no truly healthy youth, no future for one's country, no genuine religion. Listen, then, to the voice of Christ! In your lives, Christ is drawing near and saying to you: \"Follow me\". Do not close yourselves off from his love. Do not turn away. Heed his message. Each of you has received a call from him. He knows each of you by name. Let yourselves be guided by Christ as you seek that which can help you to achieve your full potential. Open the doors of your heart and your life to Jesus, \"the true hero, humble and wise, the prophet of truth and love, the companion and friend of young people\" (Message of the Second Vatican Council to Young People). 2. I am well aware of the values which distinguish the young people of Cuba: you are honest in your relationships, authentic in your aspirations, hospitable towards everyone and committed to freedom. I know that, as children of this exuberant Caribbean land, you are renowned for your artistic and creative abilities, for your joyful and enterprising spirit which is ever ready to embark on great and noble undertakings for the prosperity of the country, for your healthy enthusiasm for the things which stir your interest, and for the ease with which you overcome setbacks and limitations. These values flourish when they are given profound motivations and the freedom to develop. I have in fact been impressed by the fidelity which many of you have shown to the faith handed down from your forebears, a faith often learned on the knee of your mothers and grandmothers during the last few decades when the Church's voice seemed silenced. Today, however, the growing crisis of values being felt throughout the world is also casting its shadow over the young people of this bright island. A dangerous crisis of identity is spreading, causing young people to live in meaninglessness, without direction or plans for the future, suffocated by immediate concerns. There is a growing relativism, together with religious indifference and the lack of a clear moral sense. At the same time, people are tempted to worship the idols of the consumer society, enticed by their fleeting allure. And anything from outside the country seems more attractive. In the face of all this, the public agencies responsible for education, art, literature and the humanities and for scientific and technological research, as well as the increasing numbers of schools and teachers, have recently been trying to encourage greater concern for the pursuit of truth, the defence of beauty and the protection of what is good. But this has led many of you to ask: \"Why are all these resources and institutions not sufficient to achieve the desired result?\". The answer is not to be sought only in structures, resources and institutions, in the political system, or the effects of economic embargoes, which are always deplorable because they hurt the most needy. These are all part of the answer, but they do not touch the heart of the problem. 3. What can I say to you, the young people of Cuba, who live in material conditions which are sometimes difficult, who are sometimes frustrated in your legitimate aspirations and are even sometimes deprived of hope itself? Guided by the Spirit and in the power of the risen Christ, resist every kind of temptation to flee from the world and from society. Do not succumb to the lack of vision which leads to destroying one's personality through alcoholism, drugs, sexual irresponsibility and prostitution, the constant pursuit of new experiences. Do not take refuge in sects, alienating spiritualist cults or groups which are completely foreign to the culture and tradition of your country. \"Keep alert, stand firm in your faith, be courageous. Let all that you do be done in love\" (1 Cor 16:13-14). But what does it mean to be courageous? It means to overcome evil in all its forms. The worst evil is sin, which causes all sorts of suffering and can even lurk within us, negatively affecting our behaviour. And so, while it is right to be committed to the struggle against evil in its public and social manifestations, the first duty of believers is to fight against sin, the root of all the forms of evil which can take root in the human heart, and to resist its enticements with God's help. Be assured that God does not hinder or waste your youth, nor does he disturb your happiness. On the contrary! Far from imposing limitations, God's power gradually brings about the growth of the whole person in body, mind and heart, a deepening of faith and the expansion of your love for yourselves, for your neighbour and for all earthly and spiritual realities. If you learn to be open to God's initiative, you will experience the power of the \"one who is fully alive, Christ eternally young\" (Message of the Second Vatican Council to Young People). Jesus wants you to have life, and to have it in abundance (cf. Jn 10:10). The life which is revealed to us in God, while it may at times appear difficult, provides direction and deep meaning along the path of human development. The Church's traditions, the sacramental life and a constant recourse to prayer are not just duties or rites to be performed. Rather, they are unfathomable sources of grace which can enliven your youth and help it to grow in virtue, apostolic zeal and true hope. 4. Virtue is that inner strength which leads to self-sacrifice for love of what is good, and which enables people not only to do good deeds but also to give the very best of themselves. Virtuous young people are what makes a country great. Cuba's future depends on you, on how you build your character and on how you translate into action your commitment to transform the world. And so I say to you: with fortitude and temperance, with justice and prudence, face the great challenges of the present moment; return to your Cuban and Christian roots, and do all that you can to build a future of ever greater dignity and freedom! Do not forget that freedom involves responsibility. A person is defined above all by his responsible behaviour towards others and before history (cf. Gaudium et spes, n. 55). No one should avoid the challenges of the time in which he lives. Take your proper place in the great family of the peoples of this continent and of the world, not as inferiors seeking acceptance, but as men and women possessing a great and rich tradition, the origins of which are found in Christianity. I also wish to speak to you about commitment. Commitment is the courageous response of people who do not want to let life pass them by but rather seek to shape their own personal history and the history of the society around them. I encourage you to make a concrete commitment, however humble and simple, but one which, if carried out with perseverance, will be the best proof of your love and the best path to personal holiness. Make a responsible commitment to your families, to the life of your communities, to civil society and, when the time comes, to the future direction of the nation. You cannot be truly committed to your country unless you carry out your duties and meet your obligations in the family, at the university, in the workplace, in the world of culture and sports, in all the different settings in which the nation becomes a reality and civil society brings together the unrivalled creativity of the human person. Nor can you be committed to the Church without being actively and resolutely present in all the areas of society in which Christ and the Church become incarnate. By the renewing power of the Holy Spirit, Christians need to pass from mere presence to a deep and active involvement in all these areas. The best legacy you can leave to future generations will be to pass on the higher values of the Spirit. It is not a matter of merely preserving some of these, but rather of promoting an ethical and civic training which will help people to accept new values and to reshape their own character and the heart of society on the basis of an education for freedom, social justice and responsibility. ed to open their hearts and souls to the transcendent.ch he has traced in the heart of every human being.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":1998}

In this shrine, so dear to the heart of Catholics in your country, it is a message of hope among spiritual and physical tribulations which the Mother of the Lord gave to her children in 1798, announcing to them: “Have trust, be willing to suffer hardship and sorrow. I have already granted your prayers. Henceforth all those who come to pray to me in this spot will see their wishes fulfilled”. For two centuries this message, still up to date, has been fervently welcomed in La Vang. Despite the great trials which have marked it in the course of its history, it has now become a national Marian centre which has been able to keep alive the tradition of pilgrimages. Many people, of all origins and all conditions, come here privately to entrust their troubles and hopes to their Mother in heaven. Bishops, priests, religious and lay people like to find in her the welcoming presence of the One who gives them the courage to bear an admirable witness of Christian life in circumstances that are often difficult. I bless God who never abandons the people who seek him and who, with the motherly assistance of the Virgin Mary, continues to guide them, in days of happiness and of adversity. I hope that the faithful who will come to pray to Our Lady of La Vang at her shrine during this jubilee year and those who will invoke her in other places will find a new apostolic impetus for their Christian life and receive comfort and strength, to face life’s trials. I invite them to see in Mary the Mother Jesus himself gave to men, who leads them towards her divine Son. Having lived her condition as a disciple of the Lord perfectly, she calls Christians to progress on the path of a fervent life in accordance with the Gospel. May she make them pilgrims of steadfast faith in the person of Christ, the one Saviour of humanity, pilgrims of hope, waiting anxiously for the hour of God, for the harvest of the seed already scattered on the ground, pilgrims of charity living their vocation of unity, fraternity and service amidst their brothers and sisters whose life they share! Now that we have entered the second preparatory year for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, dedicated to the Holy Spirit, I urge the Catholics of Viêt Nam to contemplate in Mary a humble human woman who allowed herself to be led by the inner action of the Spirit. In intense and deep union with God, she obeyed his call with total fidelity. May everyone discover in her a woman of silence and attentiveness, who cherished in her heart the loving presence and sanctifying action of the Lord’s Spirit which he enabled her to perceive! Never letting difficulties discourage her, she gave full expression to the longing of the Lord’s poor, a radiant model for those who put all their trust in God’s promises (cf. Tertio millennio adveniente, n. 48). As in my heart and in my prayer I join the many pilgrims of La Vang, I ardently invoke the Mother of Christ, the Mother of men, for the entire people of Viêt Nam and for the Christian communities, originally from here, who now live abroad. May they put their trust in the Virgin most holy who maternally accompanies them on their earthly pilgrimage! Wherever they live, may they be faithful and generous disciples of Christ, witnessing to God’s infinite love amidst their brothers and sisters! On this happy occasion of the second centenary of the apparitions of the Blessed Virgin, I send you, Your Eminence, my affectionate Apostolic Blessing which I willingly extend to the Bishops, to the priests and to those preparing for the priesthood, to the religious and to all the faithful of Viêt Nam and the diaspora.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Letter","year":1997}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf792733bdc0178ba0335"},"text":"To my Venerable Brother Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith It is my deep desire, Your Eminence, to express my heartfelt thanks to you for the initiative taken by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under your direction, to organize a symposium on the theme: The Primacy of the Successor of Peter and to ask for the collaboration of many renowned scholars and experts. Please convey to all the distinguished participants my sentiments of grateful appreciation for their willingness and commitment. In the Encyclical Ut Unum sint, I recognized that it is “significant and encouraging that the question of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome has now become a subject of study which is already under way or will be in the near future. It is likewise significant and encouraging that this question appears as an essential theme not only in the theological dialogues in which the Catholic Church is engaging with other Churches and Ecclesial Communities, but also more generally in the ecumenical movment as a whole” (n. 89). The Catholic Church is aware of having preserved, in fidelity to the Apostolic Tradition and the faith of the Fathers, the ministry of the Successor of Peter, whom God has made the “perpetual and visible source and foundation of unity” (Lumen gentium, n. 23). This service to unity, rooted in the work of divine mercy, is a gift entrusted, within the same College of Bishops, to the one who succeeds the Apostle Peter as Bishop of Rome. The same power and authority proper to this ministry, without which this function would be illusory, must always be seen in the perspective of service to the merciful plan of God who desires all to be “one” in Christ Jesus. In this capacity, the primacy is exercised at different levels regarding the service to the unity of the faith, to vigilance over the celebration of the sacraments and the liturgy, to mission, to discipline and Christian life, in the awareness, however, that all this must always take place in communion. At the same time, it must also be emphasized that the Petrine ministry's service to the unity of the faith and of the Church is a form and instrument of evangelization: the very destiny of the new evangelization is linked to the Church’s witness to unity, of which the Successor of Peter is the guarantor and visible sign. On the other hand, as I stated during my meeting with the World Council of Churches in Geneva in June 1984, this conviction of the Catholic Church “is a difficulty for most of you, [the other Christians] whose memories are perhaps marked by certain sorrowful recollections” (John Paul II, Address to World Council of Churches, 2, [12 June 1984]). Thus, because of the concern for unity which is one of the primacy's essential functions, I expressed in the Encyclical Ut Unum sint my conviction that “I have a particular responsibility in this regard, above all in acknowledging the ecumenical aspirations of the majority of the Christian Communities and in heeding the request made of me to find a way of exercising the primacy which, while in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission, is nonetheless open to a new situation” (n. 95). This requirement is also expressed in the Letter of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Communionis notio, on some aspects of the Church understood as communion, where it is hoped that “all may be enabled to recognize the continuity of the primacy of Peter in his Successors, the Bishops of Rome, and to see the Petrine ministry fulfilled, in the manner intended by the Lord, as a worldwide apostolic service, which is present in all the Churches from within, and which, while preserving its substance as a divine institution, can find expression in various ways according to the different circumstances of time and place, as history has shown” (n. 18). In your symposium, the commitment of scholars, experts in the various theological disciplines — biblical, historical and systematic theology — testifies to the precision and thoroughness of the research carried out in the different fields of theological knowledge, which, according to the doctrinal form given to the study meeting, wishes to make an important contribution to the service of furthering the theological dialogue, precisely by indicating the essential elements of the teaching of the Catholic faith on this aspect of ecclesiology, and by distinguishing them from questions that are legitimately disputable or at least not definitively binding. This particular characteristic, far from constituting a difficulty for the same ecumenical dialogue, is instead a necessary condition for it to be an instrument for recognizing the divine truth. I therefore follow your work with deep interest, as I extend to you, venerable Brother, and to all who are attending and collaborating in the symposium, my fervent wishes for its success, thanks to the joint sincere and disinterested search for the truth. I accompany these wishes with a special Apostolic Blessing.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Letter","year":1996}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cf833733bdc0178ba0336"},"text":"Reverend Father, On the occasion of the fourth centenary of the dies natalis of St Philip Neri, Florentine by birth and Roman by adoption, I am pleased to address you and all the members of the Confederation of the Oratory, to recall its founder's example of holiness and to strengthen in each one the commitment of faith, active charity and enduring in hope (cf. 1 Thes 1:3). 1. The loving figure of the \"saint of joy\" even today still maintains intact that irresistible charm that he exercised on all those who drew near him to learn to know and experience the authentic sources of Christian joy. Leafing through the biography of St Philip, in fact, one is surprised and fascinated by the cheerful and relaxed method he used to educate, supporting each person with fraternal generosity and patience. As is well known, the saint used to put his teaching into short and wise maxims: \"Be good, if you can\"; \"Scruples and melancholy, stay away from my house\"; \"Be simple and humble\"; \"He who does not pray is a speechless animal\"; and, bringing his hand to his forehead, \"Holiness is three fingers deep\". Behind the cleverness of these and many other \"sayings\", we are aware of the acute and realistic knowledge he had acquired of human nature and the dynamics of grace. He translated the experience of his long life and the wisdom of a heart inhabited by the Holy Spirit into these immediate, terse teachings. These aphorisms have now become a patrimony of wisdom as it were for Christian spirituality. 2. St Philip appears against the background of the Roman Renaissance as the \"prophet of joy\", who had decided to follow Jesus, even while being actively involved in the culture of his time, which in many respects is particularly close to that of today. Humanism, which was completely focused on man and his remarkable intellectual and practical abilities, offered the rediscovery of a joyous naturalistic freshness, without obstacles or inhibitions, as a reaction to a certain ill-conceived medieval dourness. Man, considered almost as a pagan god, thus became the absolute protagonist. Furthermore, a sort of revision of the moral law was worked out with the objective of finding and guaranteeing happiness. St Philip, who was conscious of the aspirations of the society of his time, did not deny this yearning for joy but undertook to propose its true source, which he had discovered in the Gospel message. It is the word of Christ that traces the true image of man, revealing those features that make him a beloved child of the Father, accepted as a brother by the Incarnate Word and sanctified by the Holy Spirit. It is the laws of the Gospel and the commandments of Christ that lead to joy and happiness: this is the truth proclaimed by St Philip Neri to the young people he met in his daily apostolate. His was a message dictated by the intimate experience he had of God especially in prayer. His nightly prayer in the Catacombs of St Sebastian, where he often withdrew, was not just a search for solitude, but rather a desire to spend time conversing with the witnesses of the faith, to question them - just as the Renaissance scholars used to weave conversations with the Classics of antiquity: and from knowledge came imitation and then emulation. In St Philip, to whom the Spirit gave a \"heart of fire\" as he kept vigil on the eve of Pentecost in 1544, it is possible to glimpse the allegory of the great and divine transformations brought about through prayer. A productive and sure programme of formation for joy - our saint teaches - is nourished and rests on a harmonious constellation of choices: assiduous prayer, frequent Communion, rediscovery and use of the sacrament of Reconciliation, daily and familiar contact with the word of God, the fruitful exercise of fraternal charity and service; and then devotion to Our Lady, the model and true cause of our joy. In this regard, how can we forget his wise and efficacious warning: \"My children, be devoted to Mary: I know what I am saying! Be devoted to Mary!\". 3. Called by antonomasia the \"saint of joy\", St Philip must also be recognized as the \"Apostle of Rome\", indeed as the \"reformer of the Eternal City\". This he became almost by a natural evolution and development of the choices made under the guidance of grace. He truly was the light and salt of Rome, in the words of the Gospel (cf. Mt 5:13:16). He knew how to be \"light\" in that culture which was certainly splendid, but often only because of the indirect, glancing rays of paganism. In this social context, Philip was deferential to authority, very devoted to the deposit of truth, intrepid in announcing the Christian message. Thus he was a source of light for everyone. He did not choose the life of solitude; but, in exercising his ministry among the common people, he also wished to be \"salt\" for all those who met him. Like Jesus, he was equally able to enter into the human misery present in the noble palaces and in the alleys of Renaissance Rome. He was, at the same time, a Cyrenean and a critical conscience, an enlightened adviser and a smiling teacher. For this reason, he did not adopt Rome so much as Rome adopted him! He lived for 60 years in this city, which meanwhile was becoming populated with saints. Even if in the streets he met suffering humanity, and comforted and sustained it with the charity of a wise and very human word, he preferred to gather young people in the Oratory, his true invention! He made it a place of joyful meeting, a training ground for formation, a centre of artistic enlightenment. It was in the Oratory that St Philip, together with cultivating piety in its traditional and new expressions, undertook to reform and elevate art, restoring it to the service of God and the Church. Convinced as he was that beauty leads to goodness, he brought all that had an artistic stamp within the realm of his educational project. And he himself became a patron of various artistic forms, promoting sound initiatives that led to truth and goodness. The contribution made by St Philip to sacred music was incisive and exemplary; he urged it to be elevated from a source of foolish amusement to being a re-creation for the spirit. It was due to his initiative that musicians and composers began a reform that was to reach its highest peak in Pierluigi da Palestrina. 4. May St Philip, loving and generous man, chaste and humble saint, active and contemplative apostle, remain the constant model of the members of the Congregation of the Oratory! He offers all the Oratorians a plan and style of life that even today have a particular timeliness. May his so-called \"quadrilateral\" - humility, charity, prayer and joy - continue to be a most sound basis on which to build the interior edifice of one's spiritual life. If they can follow their founder's example, the Oratorians will continue to carry out a significant role in Church affairs. I therefore exhort all the sons and daughters of St Philip Neri always to be faithful to the Oratorian vocation, by seeking Christ, following him with perseverance and becoming generous sowers of joy among young people, who are so often tempted to discouragement and lack of confidence. With these wishes I wish to invoke the heavenly protection of St Philip Neri on the whole Oratorian Community, while expressing my cordial wish that the jubilee celebrations will become an occasion for a stimulating rediscovery of the figure and work of this special witness to Christ, who can still teach so much, at the close of this century, to all Christians involved in the new evangelization. I accompany these wishes with a special Apostolic Blessing, which I sincerely impart to you, to the members of the Confederation of the Oratory and to all those who draw from the spirituality of the \"saint of joy\".","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Letter","year":1994}

This \"new woman\", as the Ministers General of the Franciscan families wrote of her in a recent letter, lived as a \"little plant\" in the shadow of St Francis, who led her to the heights of Christian perfection. The celebration of such a truly evangelical creature is meant most of all to be an invitation to rediscover contemplation, that spiritual journey which only the mystics experience deeply. To read her ancient biography and her writings - the \"Form of Life\", her Testament, and the four extant letters of the many she wrote to St Agnes of Prague - means being so immersed in the mystery of the triune God and of Christ, the incarnate Word, as to be dazzled. Her writings are so marked by the love stirred up in her by her loving, prolonged gazing upon Christ the Lord that it is not easy to express what only a woman's heart could experience. 2. Clare's contemplative journey, which will culminate in her vision of the \"King of glory\" (Proc IV, 19), begins precisely in her total abandonment to the Spirit of the Lord, in the same way as Mary did at the annunciation: that is to say, it begins with that spirit of poverty (cf. Lk 1:48) which empties her of everything but the simplicity of a gaze fixed on God. For Clare, poverty - which she loved so much and mentioned so often in her writings - is the wealth of the soul which, stripped of its own goods, is open to the \"Spirit of the Lord and his holy manner of working\" (cf. RCl X, 10), like an empty shell in which God can pour out an abundance of his gifts. The Mary-Clare parallel appears in St Francis' earliest writing, in the Forma vivendi he gave to Clare: \"By divine inspiration you have made yourselves daughters and servants of the Most High King, the heavenly Father, and have taken the Holy Spirit as your spouse, choosing to live according to the perfection of the holy Gospel\" (Forma vivendi, in RCl VI, 3). The Spirit creates an image of God's Son in the Christian Clare and her sisters are called \"spouses of the Holy Spirit\": an expression not common in the Church's history, in which a sister, a nun, is always described as the \"spouse of Christ\". However, here we have the resonance of some expressions from Luke's account of the annunciation (cf. Lk 1:26-38), which become key words for expressing Clare's experience: the \"Most High\", the \"Holy Spirit\", the \"Son of God\", the \"handmaid of the Lord\" and, lastly, that \"over-shadowing\" which for Clare is her investiture, when her hair was shorn and fell at the foot of our Lady's altar in the Portiuncula, \"before her bridal chamber, as it were\" (cf. LegCl 8). 3. \"The Spirit of the Lord and his holy manner of working\", which is given to us in Baptism, is that of creating in a Christian the image of the Son of God. In solitude and silence, which Clare chooses as a form of life for herself and her sisters within the most poor walls of her monastery half-way between Assisi and the Portiuncula, the curtain of smoke of words and earthly things fades away, and communion with God becomes a reality: love which is born and which gives of itself. Clare, bowed down in contemplating the Infant of Bethlehem, exhorts us: Since this vision \"is the splendour of eternal glory, the brilliance of eternal light and the mirror without blemish, gaze upon that mirror each day.... Look at... the poverty of him who was placed in a manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes. O marvellous humility! O astonishing poverty! The King of angels, the Lord of heaven and earth, is laid in a manger\" (4LAg 14, 19-21). She did not even notice that through her contemplation and transformation, her womb as a consecrated and \"poor virgin\" attached to the \"poor Christ\" (cf. 2LAg 18) had become a cradle of the Son of God (Proc IX, 4). It is the voice of this Child which, at a time of great danger - when the monastery was about to fall into the hands of Saracen troops in the employ of Emperor Frederick II - reassures her from the Eucharist: It \"will be defended by my protection\" (LegCl 22). On Christmas eve in 1252, the Child Jesus bore Clare far away from her bed of illness and love, which knows neither time nor place, and enveloped her in a mystical experience which immersed her in the infinite abyss of God. 4. If Catherine of Siena is the saintly woman full of passion for the Blood of Christ, the great St Teresa is the woman who goes from \"mansion\" to \"mansion\" to the threshold of the great King in the Interior Castle and Therese of the Child Jesus is the one who, in Gospel simplicity, travels the little way, Clare is the passionate lover of the poor, crucified Christ, with whom she wants to identify absolutely. Clare fixed her eyes on the poor and crucified Christ She puts it thus in one of her letters: \"Look upon him who became contemptible for you, and follow him, making yourself contemptible in this world for him. Your Spouse, though more beautiful than the children of men, became for your salvation the lowest of men, was despised, struck, scourged untold times throughout his entire body, and then died amid the suffering of the cross.... Gaze upon him, consider him, contemplate him, as you desire to imitate him. If you suffer with him, you shall rejoice with him; if you die with him on the cross of tribulation, you shall possess heavenly mansions in the splendour of the saints, and in the Book of Life your name shall be called glorious among men\" (2LAg 19-22). Clare, who entered the monastery when she was but 18 years of age, died there at the age of 59, after a life of suffering, of constant prayer, strict observance and penance. Because of this \"ardent desire for the poor, crucified Christ\", nothing burdened her, to the point that at the end of her life she could say to Brother Raynaldo, who assisted her \"in the long martyrdom of so many illnesses\", that: \"After I once came to know the grace of my Lord Jesus Christ through his servant Francis, no pain has been bothersome, no penance too severe, no weakness, dearly beloved brother, has been hard\" (LegCl 44). 5. But the one who suffers on the cross is he who reflects the Father's glory and sweeps away in his passover those who loved him to the point of sharing his suffering out of love for him. The delicate 18-year-old who, fleeing home on the night of Palm Sunday 1212, set off without hesitation on the adventure of a new experience, believing in the Gospel as Francis showed her, and in nothing else, with the eyes of her body and of her heart totally immersed in the poor and crucified Christ, experiences this union which transforms her: \"Place your mind before the mirror of eternity\", she writes to Agnes of Prague. \"Place your soul in the brilliance of glory! Place your heart in the figure of the divine substance! And transform your entire being into the image of the Godhead itself through contemplation, so that you too may feel what his friends feel as they taste the hidden sweetness that God himself has reserved from the beginning for those who love him. Since you have cast aside all (those) things which, in this deceitful and turbulent world, ensare their blind lovers, love him totally who gave himself totally for your love\" (3LAg 12-15). Thus the hard bed of the cross becomes the sweet nuptial bed and the \"life-long recluse of love\" finds the most passionate accents of the beloved in the Song of Songs: \"Draw me after you ... O heavenly Spouse! I will run and not tire, until you bring me into the wine-cellar\" (4LAg 30-31). Enclosed in the monastery of San Damiano, in a life marked by poverty, hard work, tribulation and illness, as well as a fraternal communion so intense that, in the language of the \"Form of Life\", it could be described as \"holy unity\" (RCl, Bull of Innocent IV, 2), Clare experiences the purest joy experienced by any creature: the joy of living in Christ the perfect union of the three divine Persons, entering as it were into the ineffable circuit of Trinitarian love. Clare offered everything to the Father in union with Christ 6. Clare's life, under the guidance of Francis, was not an eremitic life, even though it was contemplative and cloistered. Around her, wanting to live like the birds of the air and the lilies of the field (Mt 6:26, 28), gathered the first group of sisters, for whom God alone sufficed. This \"little flock\", which rapidly expanded - by August 1228 there were at least 25 monasteries of \"Poor Clares\" (cf. Letter of Cardinal Raynaldo: Archivium Franciscanum Historicum 5, 1912, pp. 444-446) - had no fear (cf. Lk 12:32). The faith was the reason for their peaceful security in the face of every danger. Clare and her sisters had hearts as big as the world: as contemplatives, they interceded for the whole of humanity. Those souls that were sensitive to the daily problems of each person were able to take all difficulties upon themselves; there was no concern, suffering, anguish or discouragement of others which did not find an echo in the hearts of these prayerful women. Clare cried and pleaded with the Lord for her beloved city of Assisi when it was under siege by the troops of Vitale of Aversa, obtaining the city's liberation from war; every day she prayed for the sick and often healed them with a sign of the cross. Convinced that there can be no apostolic life unless it is immersed in the open side of Christ crucified, she wrote to Agnes of Prague in the words of St Paul: \"I consider you a co-worker of God himself (cf. Rom 16:3) and a support of the weak members of his ineffable Body\" (3LAg 8). 7. Due to a type of iconography which has been very popular since the 17th century, Clare is often depicted holding a monstrance. This gesture recalls, although in a more solemn posture, the humble reality of this woman who, although she was very sick, prostrated herself with the help of two sisters before the silver ciborium containing the Eucharist (cf. LegCl 21), which she had placed in front of the refectory door that the Emperor's troops were about to storm. Clare lived on that pure Bread which, according to the custom of the time, she could receive only seven times a year. On her sickbed she embroidered corporals and sent them to the poor churches in the Spoleto valley. In reality Clare's whole life was a eucharist because, like Francis, from her cloister she raised up a continual \"thanksgiving\" to God in her prayer, praise, supplication, intercession, weeping, offering and sacrifice. She accepted everything and offered it to the Father in union with the infinite \"thanks\" of the only-begotten Son, the Child, the Crucified, the risen One, who lives at the right hand of the Father. During this jubilee year, dear sisters, the whole Church's attention is turned with growing interest to the shining figure of your beloved mother. With how much greater fervour should you look to her in order to draw encouragement from her example and intensify your effort to respond to the Lord's grace with daily dedication and that commitment to the contemplative life from which the Church draws so much strength for her missionary activity in today's world! May Christ, our Lord, be your light and the joy of your hearts. With these wishes, as a sign of my deep affection, I impart a special Apostolic Blessing to all.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Letter","year":1993}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cfea7733bdc0178ba0338"},"text":"\"I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser\" (Jn 15:1). Dear Brother Priests, 1. Allow me to call to mind today the above words from the Gospel according to John. They are linked to the Liturgy of Holy Thursday: \"Before the feast of Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come\" (Jn 13:1), he washed his disciples' feet, and then spoke to them intimately and with great candour, as Saint John tells us. This Farewell Discourse also contains the allegory of the vine and the branches: \"I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing\" (Jn 15:5). It is precisely to this text that I wish to refer on Holy Thursday in this year of the Lord 1992, as I offer to the Church the Apostolic Exhortation on priestly formation. It is the result of the collegial work of the 1990 Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, which was entirely devoted to that subject. We worked out together a much-needed and awaited document of the Church's Magisterium, which brings together both the teaching of the Second Vatican Council and reflections on the experiences of the twenty-five years since the end of the Council. 2. Today I wish to place this result of the Synod Fathers' prayer and reflection at the feet of Christ the Priest and Pastor of our souls (cf. 1 Pt 2:25). Together with you, I wish to receive this text from the altar of the one and eternal Priesthood of the Redeemer, which in a sacramental way became our portion at the last Supper. Christ is the true Vine. If the Eternal Father cultivates his vineyard in this world, he does so in the power of the Truth and Life which are in the Son. Here are found the ever-new beginning and inexhaustible source of the formation of every Christian, and especially of every priest. On Holy Thursday let us try in a particular way to grow in our awareness of this reality and in the attitude needed for us to be able to remain, in Christ, open to the breath of the Spirit of Truth, and to bear abundant fruit in God's vineyard. 3. As we join in the Holy Thursday Liturgy with all the Pastors of the Church, let us give thanks for the gift of the Priesthood which we share. At the same time let us pray that all those throughout the world who are offered the grace of a priestly vocation will respond to this gift, so that there will be no lack of labourers for the great harvest (cf. Mt 9:37). As I express this hope I send to all of you an affectionate greeting and my Apostolic Blessing.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Letter","year":1992}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610cff31733bdc0178ba0339"},"text":"To Ambassador, Alexander Borg Olivier, President of the Holy Family Church Society of the United Nations Community In publishing the Encyclical Letter \"Centesimus Annus\", to mark the hundredth anniversary of Pope Leo XIII’s rightly famous social document \"Rerum Novarum\", my intention was not only to commemorate an important past moment of the Church’s reflection on the social question but also to make reference to the situation of the world today. \"Centesimus Annus\" is meant to be an invitation \"to `look around’ at the `new things’ which surround us and in which we find ourselves caught up\", so that men and women of good will might give further impulse to the \"great movement for the defence of the human person and the safeguarding of human dignity\" which in many parts of the world \"has contributed to the building of a more just society or at least to the curbing of injustice\" (John Paul II, Centesimus annus, 3). The hopes and expectations of the present deserve the closest attention, in order to ensure that leaders in the economic, political, cultural and religious fields do not waste the historic possibilities that lie before the human family. That is the reason for my keen interest in your Seminar and for my support for this valuable initiative undertaken by the Permanent Observer Mission of the Holy See and by the Holy Family Church Society of the United Nations Community. I thank you, Mr Ambassador, for presiding over this meeting and I greet all who are taking part. I extend a particular word of greeting to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Dr Javier Pérez de Cuellar, and to the distinguished Representatives of the various countries present at the event. I pray that your reflection will further confirm you in your already deep commitment to the consolidation of justice and peace in the world. The transformations of recent months have reduced the ideological tensions which had characterized international life for many decades. But this new situation must not blind us to the fact that immense problems of injustice and human suffering continue to afflict millions of human beings. There are many tragic situations which call for an immediate and more generous response from the international community. Furthermore, the increasingly global nature of the productive and economic processes means that the struggle for development and justice must necessarily take into account the interdependence of peoples and nations. A global sensitivity and solidarity towards the poorer peoples of the world is urgently needed. Either the human family as a whole learns to tread the path of cooperation and solidarity, and seeks to enable everyone to share in the benefits of progress, or a new age of fragmentation and endemic conflict will open up before us. The challenge is \"to situate particular interests within the framework of a coherent vision of the common good\" (Ibid, n. 47). As you gather to reflect on \"Centesimus Annus\", I trust that you will be ever more convinced that the common good cannot be served unless appropriate attention is given to the ethical and moral dimensions of economic, social and political questions. The attempt to organize society in a moral vacuum is a false and harmful pretense, for freedom is intrinsically bound to responsibility, and decisions about public policy involve accountability not just to public opinion but above all to the objective truth about man’s nature and the order of human society. In meeting the challenges of the present hour, Christians have an essential contribution to make. The Church’s spiritual and humanitarian mission involves them at the very heart of the struggle for human development and progress. \"Centesimus Annus\", leaves no doubt about the Church’s willingness to play her part in building a better future for the human family: \"To those who are searching today for a new and authentic theory and praxis of liberation, the Church offers not only her social doctrine and, in general, her teaching about the human person redeemed in Christ, but also her concrete commitment and material assistance in the struggle against marginalization and suffering\" (Ibid, n. 26). As I wrote in the conclusion of the Encyclical: \"In the third Millennium too, the Church will be faithful in making man’s way her own, knowing that she does not walk alone, but with Christ her Lord. It is Christ who made man’s way his own, and who guides him, even when he is unaware of it\" (Ibid, n. 62). It is my earnest hope that those taking part in the Seminar will find encouragement and inspiration for further action in the healing and elevating impact on economic and social realities of the Church’s social doctrine. The Gospel truths and values on which this doctrine is based strengthen the seams of human society and imbue everyday human activity with a deeper meaning and importance (cf. Gaudium et spes, 40). I therefore raise my heart in prayer to the Lord of history, asking him to bless you, Mr Ambassador, and all present at the Seminar. May his light and guidance accompany you always.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Letter","year":1991}

{"_id":{"$oid":"610d00c3733bdc0178ba033d"},"text":"1. At the end of this Eucharistic celebration, I invite you to join me in praying the Angelus. This prayer takes its name from the Angel’s message to Mary: “Rejoice . . . the Lord is with you”. Soon, in the Christmas liturgy, you will hear those other words of joy which announced the birth of Jesus: “Listen, I bring you news of great joy, a joy to be shared by all the people”. I have said before on another occasion: “In a true sense, joy is the keynote of the Christian message\". As I said then, my wish is that the Christian message may bring joy to all who open their hearts to it: “joy to children, joy to parents, joy to families and to friends, joy to workers and scholars, joy to the sick and to the elderly, joy to all humanity”. I now add: “joy - deep and lasting joy - to the people of Australia”. 2. Faith is our source of joy We believe in a God who created us so that we might enjoy human happiness - in some measure on earth, in its fullness in heaven. We are meant to have our human joys: the joy of living, the joy of love and friendship, the joy of work well done. We who are Christians have a further cause for joy: like Jesus, we know that we are loved by God our Father. This love transforms our lives and fills us with joy. It makes us see that Jesus did not come to lay burdens upon us. He came to teach us what it means to be fully happy and fully human. Therefore, we discover joy when we discover truth - the truth about God our Father, the truth about Jesus our Saviour, the truth about the Holy Spirit who lives in our hearts. 3. We do not pretend that life is all beauty. We are aware of darkness and sin, of poverty and pain. But we know Jesus has conquered sin and passed through his own pain to the glory of the Resurrection. And we live in the light of his Paschal Mystery - the mystery of his Death and Resurrection. “We are an Easter People and Alleluia is our song!”. We are not looking for a shallow joy but rather a joy that comes from faith, that grows through unselfish love, that respects the “fundamental duty of love of neighbour, without which it would be unbecoming to speak of Joy”. We realize that joy is demanding; it demands unselfishness; it demands a readiness to say with Mary: “Be it done unto me according to thy word”. 4. Mary, our Mother: I turn to you and with the Church I invoke you as Mother of Joy (Mater plena sanctae laetitiae). I, John Paul II, entrust to you the Church in Australia, and ask you to pour out upon all her members that holy human joy which was God’s gift to you. Help all your children to see that the good things in their lives come to them from God the Father through your Son Jesus Christ. Help them to experience in the Holy Spirit the joy which filled your own Immaculate Heart. And in the midst of the sufferings and trials of life may they find the fullness of joy that belongs to the victory of your Crucified Son, and comes forth from his Sacred Heart. Today is the feast of Saint Andrew, the Patron of the Church of Constantinople. Every year the Church of Rome sends a delegation to share this feast, just as the Church of Constantinople does for the feast of Saints Peter and Paul. Once again I send greetings to our beloved sister Church. ","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Angelus","year":1986}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d87250a910b526c92c831"},"text":"Brothers and sisters, good morning! When it comes to the Gospel and the mission to evangelise, Paul is enthusiastic, he comes out of himself. He seems to see nothing other than this mission that the Lord has entrusted to him. Everything in him is dedicated to this proclamation, and he has no interest other than the Gospel. It is Paul’s love, Paul’s interest, Paul’s profession: to proclaim. He even goes so far as to say: 'Christ did not send me to baptise, but to preach the Gospel' (1 Cor 1:17). Paul interprets his whole existence as a call to evangelise, to make Christ’s message known, to make the Gospel known: “Woe to me”, he says, \"if I do not preach the Gospel\" (1 Cor 9:16). And writing to the Christians of Rome, he presents himself simply as follows: \"Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, an apostle by calling, chosen to proclaim the Gospel of God\" (Rom 1:1). This is his vocation. In short, he is aware that he has been \"set apart\" to bring the Gospel to all, and he cannot but devote himself with all his strength to this mission. One can therefore understand the sadness, the disappointment and even the bitter irony of the Apostle towards the Galatians, who in his eyes are taking the wrong path, which will lead to them to a point of no return: they have taken the wrong path. The pivot around which everything revolves is the Gospel. Paul does not think of the “four Gospels”, as is natural for us, Indeed, while he is sending this Letter, none of the four Gospels had yet been written. For him the Gospel is what he preaches, what is called the kerygma, that is, the proclamation. And what proclamation? That of the death and resurrection of Jesus as the source of salvation. A Gospel that is expressed in four verbs: “Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and he appeared the Cephas, then to the twelve” (I Cor 15: 3-5). This is Paul’s proclamation, the proclamation that gives life to all. This Gospel is the fulfilment of the promises and the salvation offered to all men. Whoever accepts it is reconciled to God, is welcomed as a true son, and receives the inheritance of eternal life. Faced with such a great gift to the Galatians, the Apostle cannot explain why they might think of accepting another “gospel”, perhaps more sophisticated, more intellectual, I don’t know … but another “gospel”. It should be noted, however, that these Christians have not yet abandoned the Gospel announced by Paul. The Apostle knows that they are still in time not to take a false step, but he warns them strongly, very strongly. His first argument points directly to the fact that the preaching carried out by the new missionaries - those who bring novelty, who preach - cannot be the Gospel. On the contrary, it is a proclamation that distorts the true Gospel because it prevents them from attaining the freedom acquired by arriving at faith - this is the key word, isn’t it? - it prevents them from reaching the freedom acquired by coming to faith. The Galatians are still \"beginners\" and their disorientation is understandable. They do not yet know the complexities of the Mosaic Law and their enthusiasm in embracing faith in Christ leads them to listen to these new preachers, deluding themselves that their message is complementary to Paul’s. And it is not. However, the Apostle, cannot risk compromises on such decisive ground. The Gospel is only one and that is what he proclaimed; there can be no other. Beware! Paul does not say that the true Gospel is his because it was he who announced it, no! He does not say this. This would be presumptuous, it would be boastful. Rather, he affirms that \"his\" Gospel, the same one that the other Apostles were proclaiming elsewhere, is the only authentic one, because it is that of Jesus Christ. He thus writes: “I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not man’s gospel, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ” (Gal 1:11). We can understand why Paul uses very harsh terms. Twice he uses the expression “anathema”, which indicates the need to keep far from the community that which threatens its foundations. And this new “gospel” threatens the foundations of the community. In short, on this point the Apostle leaves no room for negotiation: one cannot negotiate. With the truth of the Gospel, one cannot negotiate. Either you receive the Gospel as it is, as it was announced, or you receive any other thing. But you cannot negotiate with the Gospel. One cannot compromise. Faith in Jesus is not a bargaining chip: it is salvation, it is encounter, it is redemption. It cannot be sold off cheaply. This situation described at the beginning of the Letter seems paradoxical, because all those involved seem to be animated by good feelings. The Galatians who listen to the new missionaries think that by circumcision they will be even more devoted to the will of God and thus be even more pleasing to Paul. Paul's enemies seem to be inspired by fidelity to the tradition received from the fathers and believe that genuine faith consists in observing the Law. In the face of this supreme fidelity, they even justify their insinuations and suspicions about Paul, who is considered unorthodox with regard to tradition. The Apostle himself is well aware that his mission is of a divine nature - it was revealed by Christ Himself, to him - and therefore he is moved by total enthusiasm for the novelty of the Gospel, which is a radical novelty, not a fleeting novelty: there are no “fashionable” gospels, the Gospel is always new, it is newness. His pastoral anxiety leads him to be severe, because he sees the great risk facing young Christians. In short, in this labyrinth of good intentions it is necessary to disentangle oneself in order to grasp the supreme truth that is most consistent with the Person and preaching of Jesus and His revelation of the Father's love. This is important: knowing how to discern. Very often we have seen throughout history, and we even see this today, some movements that preach the Gospel in their own way, sometimes with real and genuine charisms; but then they take it too far and reduce all the Gospel to a “movement”. And this is not Christ’s Gospel: this is the Gospel of the founder and yes, it may help at the beginning, but in the end it does not bear fruit with deep roots. For this reason, Paul's clear and decisive word was salutary for the Galatians and is salutary for us too. The Gospel is Christ’s gift to us, He Himself revealed it to us. It is what gives us life. Thank you.","pope":"Francis","type":"Audience","year":2021}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d875c0a910b526c92c832"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, good morning! Today, I would like to focus on the prayer of thanksgiving. And I take my cue from an episode recounted by the Evangelist Luke. While Jesus was on the way, ten lepers approached Him, begging: “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!” (17:13). We know that those who had leprosy suffered not only physically, but also from social marginalization and religious marginalization. They were marginalized. Jesus did not back off from meeting them. Sometimes, he went beyond the limitations imposed by the law and touched the sick — which was not permitted — he embraced and healed them. In this case, there was no contact. From a distance, Jesus invited them to present themselves to the priests (v. 14), who were designated by law to certify any healings that had occurred. Jesus said nothing else. He listened to their prayer, he heard their cry for mercy, and he sent them immediately to the priests. Those 10 lepers trusted, they did not remain there until they were cured, no: they trusted and they went immediately, and while they were on their way, all 10 of them were cured. The priests would have therefore been able to verify their healing and readmit them to normal life. But here is the most important point: only one in the group, before going to the priests, returned to thank Jesus and to praise God for the grace received. Only one, the other nine continued on their way. And Jesus points out that that man was a Samaritan, a sort of “heretic” for the Jews of that time. Jesus comments: “Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” (17:18). This narrative is touching. This narrative, so to speak, divides the world in two: those who do not give thanks and those who do; those who take everything as if it is owed them, and those who welcome everything as a gift, as grace. The Catechism says: “every event and need can become an offering of thanksgiving” (n. 2638). The prayer of thanksgiving always begins from here: from the recognition that grace precedes us. We were thought of before we learned how to think; we were loved before we learned how to love; we were desired before our hearts conceived a desire. If we view life like this, then “thank you” becomes the driving force of our day. And how often we even forget to say “thank you”. For us Christians, thanksgiving was the name given to the most essential Sacrament there is: the Eucharist . In fact, the Greek word means precisely this: thanksgiving . Eucharist: thanksgiving. Christians, as all believers, bless God for the gift of life. To live is above all to have received life. All of us are born because someone wanted us to have life. And this is only the first of a long series of debts that we incur by living. Debts of gratitude. During our lives, more than one person has gazed on us with pure eyes, gratuitously. Often, these people are educators, catechists, persons who carried out their roles above and beyond what was required of them. And they stirred gratitude within us. Even friendship is a gift for which we should always be grateful. This “thank you” that we must say continually, this thanks that Christians share with everyone, grows in the encounter with Jesus. The Gospels attest that when Jesus passed by, he often stirred joy and praise to God in those who met Him. The Gospel accounts of Christmas are filled with prayerful people whose hearts are greatly moved by the coming of the Saviour. And we too were called to participate in this immense jubilation. The episode of the ten lepers who are healed also suggests this. Naturally, they were all happy about having recovered their health, thus being allowed to end that unending forced quarantine that excluded them from the community. But among them, there was one who experienced an additional joy: in addition to being healed, he rejoices at the encounter with Jesus. He is not only freed from evil, but he now possesses the certainty of being loved. This is the crux: when you thank someone, you express the certainty that you are loved. And this is a huge step: to have the certainty that you are loved. It is the discovery of love as the force that governs the world. Dante would say: the Love that “moves the sun and other stars” (Paradise, XXIII, 145). We are no longer vagabonds wandering aimlessly here and there, no: we have a home, we dwell in Christ, and from that “dwelling” we contemplate the rest of the world which appears infinitely more beautiful to us. We are children of love, we are brothers and sisters of love. We are men and women of grace. Therefore, brothers and sisters, let us seek to remain always in the joy of the encounter with Jesus. Let us cultivate joyfulness. The devil, instead, after having deluded us — with whatever temptation — always leaves us sad and alone. If we are in Christ, there is no sin and no threat that can ever prevent us from continuing our journey with joy, along with many fellow travel companions. Above all, let us not forget to thank: if we are bearers of gratitude, the world itself will become better, even if only a little bit, but that is enough to transmit a bit of hope. The world needs hope. And with gratitude, with this attitude of thanksgiving, we transmit a bit of hope. Everything is united and everything is connected, and each one can do their part wherever they are. The path to happiness is the one that Saint Paul described at the end of one of his letters: “Pray constantly, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit” (1Thess 5:17-19). Do not quench the Spirit, what a beautiful project of life! Not quenching the Spirit that we have within leads us to gratitude.

{"_id":{"$oid":"610d88100a910b526c92c833"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Good Morning! It will be Christmas in one week. During these days as we rush to prepare for the feast day we can ask ourselves: “How am I preparing for the Birth of the celebrated One?”. A simple, yet effective way to prepare oneself is to set up a nativity scene. I too followed this path this year: I went to Greccio where Saint Francis created the first nativity scene with the local people. And I wrote a Letter to mark the significance of this tradition, what the nativity scene means during the Christmas period. Indeed, the nativity scene is “like a living Gospel” (Apostolic Letter Admirabile Signum, n. 1). It brings the Gospel to the places where people live: in homes, schools, work and meeting places, hospitals, retirement homes, prisons and in the squares. And in those places where we live, it reminds us of an essential thing: that God did not remain invisible in Heaven, but rather came to earth, became man, a child. To make a nativity scene is to celebrate God’s closeness. God has always been close to his people but when he became incarnate and was born, he was very close, extremely close. To make a nativity scene is to celebrate God’s closeness; to rediscover that God is real, concrete, alive and vibrant. God is not a distant lord or a detached judge but rather humble Love that descended upon us. The Child in the nativity scene transmits his tenderness to us. Some small figurines portray the “Bambinello” with open arms to tell us that God came to embrace our humanity. It is beautiful then to stand before the nativity scene and to confide our lives to the Lord, to speak to him of the people and situations that we have in our heart, to take stock with him of the year that is ending, to share our expectations and apprehensions. We can see Mary and Joseph beside Jesus. We can guess the thoughts and feelings they had as the Babe was being born in poverty: joy but also dismay. And we can also invite the Holy Family into our homes where there are joys and worries, where we wake up each day, we eat and sleep close to the people who are dearest to us. The nativity scene is a “domestic Gospel”. The word “presepe” (nativity scene in Italian) literally means “manger” whereas Bethlehem, the town of the nativity scene, means “house of bread”. Manger and house of bread: the nativity scene we set up at home where we share food and affection reminds us that Jesus is the nourishment, the bread of life (cf. Jn 6:34). He is the One who sustains our love. He is the One who gives our families the strength to carry on and forgive one another. The nativity scene offers us another life lesson. In today’s at times frenetic pace, it is an invitation to contemplation. It reminds us of the importance of pausing. Because only when we know how to recollect ourselves can we welcome what truly matters in life. Only if we leave the din of the world outside our home can we open ourselves to listen to God who speaks in silence. The nativity scene is current, it is the newness of each family. Yesterday I was given a small image of a special nativity scene, very small, which was called: “Let us let Mum rest”. There was Our Lady asleep and Joseph putting the Babe to sleep. How many of you husbands and wives have to take turns during the night because the baby is crying, crying, crying. “Let Mum rest” is the tenderness of a family, of a marriage. The nativity scene is more timely now than ever, when every day, throughout the world, so many weapons and violent images that penetrate our eyes and hearts are being produced. The nativity scene instead is an artisanal image of peace. This is why it is a living Gospel. Dear brothers and sisters, from the nativity scene we can grasp a teaching on the very meaning of life. We see everyday scenes: shepherds with their sheep, blacksmiths forging iron, millers making bread. Sometimes there are landscapes and circumstances from our areas. It is right because the nativity scene reminds us that Jesus comes into our concrete lives. And this is important. Always make a small nativity scene at home because it is a reminder that God came to us; he was born among us, he accompanies us throughout our lives. He is man like we are. He became man like us. In everyday life, we are no longer alone. He abides in us. He does not magically change things but if we welcome Him, everything can change. I hope that setting up the nativity scene will be for you all an opportunity to invite Jesus into your lives. When we make the nativity scene at home it is like opening a door and saying: “Come in, Jesus!”. It is making this closeness concrete, this invitation to Jesus to come into our lives. Because if he abides in our lives, life is reborn. And if life is reborn, it is truly Christmas. Happy Christmas to everyone!","pope":"Francis","type":"Audience","year":2019}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d88330a910b526c92c834"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Good morning! In today’s catechesis, which concludes the series on the Ten Commandments, we can take as the key theme that of desires, which allows us to review the journey we have made and summarize the stages we have completed in reading the text of the Decalogue, always in the light of the full revelation in Christ. We began with gratitude as the basis of the relationship of trust and obedience: God, as we saw, asked for nothing before he had given much more. He invites us to obedience in order to deliver us from the misleading forms of idolatry that have so much power over us. Indeed, seeking self-realization in the idols of this world empties us and enslaves us, while what gives us stature and consistency is the relationship with the One who, in Christ, makes us children by virtue of his fatherhood (cf. Eph 3:14-16). This entails a process of blessing and liberation, which is true, authentic rest. As the Psalm states: “For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation” (Ps 62[61]:1). This liberated life embraces our personal history and reconciles us with what, from childhood to the present, we have experienced, becoming adults and being able to give the proper weight to the realities and the people in our life. By this path we enter a relationship with our neighbour which, springing from the love that God demonstrates in Jesus Christ, is a call to the beauty of fidelity, generosity and authenticity. But to live in this way — that is, in the beauty of fidelity, generosity and authenticity — we need a new heart, inhabited by the Holy Spirit (cf. Ez 11:19; 36:26). I wonder: how does this heart ‘transplant’, from an old heart to a new heart, come about? Through the gift of new desires (cf. Rom 8:6) that are sown in us by the grace of God, in a particular way, through the Ten Commandments fulfilled by Jesus, as he teaches in the ‘Sermon on the Mount’ (cf. Mt 5:15-48). Indeed, in contemplating the life described in the Decalogue — that is, a grateful, free, authentic, blessed, adult existence, as guardian and lover of a steadfast, generous and sincere life — almost without realizing it we stand before Christ again. The Decalogue is his ‘x-ray’: it is like a photographic negative that lets his face appear — as in the Holy Shroud. And thus the Holy Spirit renders our heart fruitful, placing in it desires that are his gift, the desires of the Spirit. To desire according to the Spirit, to desire with the rhythm of the Spirt, to desire with the music of the Spirit. Looking to Christ we see beauty, goodness, truth. And the Spirit engenders a life that, supporting these desires of his, kindles hope, faith and love in us. In this way we can better understand why the Lord Jesus did not come to abolish the law but to fulfil it, to develop it, and as the law according to the flesh was a series of prescriptions and prohibitions, according to the Spirit this same law becomes life (cf. Jn 6:63; Eph 2:15), because it is no longer a rule but the very flesh of Christ, who loves us, seeks us, forgives us, consoles us and in his Body recreates the communion with the Father, lost through the disobedience of sin. And thus, the literal negative, the negative expression used in the Commandments — ‘you shall not steal’, ‘you shall not insult’, ‘you shall not kill’ — that ‘not’ is transformed into a positive approach: to love, to make room in my heart for others, all desires that sow positivity. And this is the fullness of the law that Jesus came to bring us. In Christ, and in him alone, the Decalogue ceases to be a condemnation (cf. Rom 8:1) and becomes the authentic truth of human life, namely, a desire for love — a desire for good, to do good is born here — a desire for joy, for peace, for magnanimity, for benevolence, for goodness, for fidelity, for meekness, self-control. It goes from that ‘no’ to this ‘yes’: the positive attitude of a heart that opens with the power of the Holy Spirit. This is what seeking Christ in the Decalogue means: to make our heart fruitful so that it may be filled with love and open to God’s work. When men and women comply with the desire to live according to Christ, they are opening the door to salvation which cannot fail to occur because God the Father is generous and, as the Catechism says, “thirsts that we may thirst for him” (n. 2560). If evil desires defile mankind (cf. Mt 15:18-20), the Spirit places in our heart his holy desires which are the seeds of new life (cf. 1 Jn 3:9). Indeed, the new life is not a titanic effort to comply with a rule, but rather, the new life is God’s own Spirit that begins to guide us to his fruits, in a happy synergy between our joy in being loved and his joy in loving us. The two joys come together: God’s joy in loving us and our joy in being loved. This is what the Decalogue is for us Christians: to contemplate Christ in order to open ourselves up to receive his heart, to receive his will, to receive his Holy Spirit.","pope":"Francis","type":"Audience","year":2018}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d885f0a910b526c92c835"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Good morning! Continuing with the catecheses on the Mass, we can ask ourselves: what essentially is the Mass? The Mass is the memorial of Christ’s Passover. It makes us participants in his victory over sin and death, and gives full meaning to our life. For this reason, to understand the value of the Mass, we must first understand the biblical significance of “memorial”. It is “not merely the recollection of past events but makes them in a certain way present and real. This is how Israel understands its liberation from Egypt: every time Passover is celebrated, the Exodus events are made present to the memory of believers so that they may conform their lives to them” (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1363). Jesus Christ, with his passion, death, resurrection and ascension into heaven brought the Passover to fulfillment. And the Mass is the memorial of his Passover, of his “exodus”, which he carried out for us, so as to lead us out of slavery and introduce us to the promised land of eternal life. It is not merely a remembrance, no. It is more: it is making present what happened 20 centuries ago. The Eucharist always leads us to the pinnacle of the salvific action of God: the Lord Jesus, making himself Bread broken for us, pours out upon us his mercy and his love, as he did on the Cross, thus renewing our hearts, our existence and our way of relating to him and to our brothers and sisters. The Second Vatican Council said: “As often as the sacrifice of the cross[,] in which Christ our Passover was sacrificed, is celebrated on the altar, the work of our redemption is carried on” (Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium, 3). Every celebration of the Eucharist is a ray of that never setting sun that is the Risen Jesus. Taking part in the Mass, particularly on Sunday, means entering the victory of the Risen One, being illuminated by his light, warmed by his compassion. Through the Eucharistic celebration the Holy Spirit makes us participants in the divine life that is able to transfigure our whole mortal being. In his passage from death to life, from time to eternity, the Lord Jesus also draws us with him to experience the Passover. In the Mass we celebrate Passover. We, during Mass, are with Jesus, who died and is Risen, and he draws us forth to eternal life. In the Mass we unite with him. Rather, Christ lives in us and we live in him: “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ”, Saint Paul states, “who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me” (Gal 2:20). This is what Paul thought. Indeed, his Blood frees us from death and from the fear of death. It frees us not only from the dominion of physical death, but from the spiritual death which is evil, sin, which catches us each time we fall victim to our own sin or that of others. Thus our life becomes polluted; it loses beauty; it loses meaning; it withers. Instead, Christ restores our life; Christ is the fullness of life, and when he faced death he destroyed it forever: “By rising he destroyed death and restored life” (cf. Eucharistic Prayer iv). Christ’s Passover is the definitive victory over death, because he transformed his death in the supreme act of love. He died out of love! And in the Eucharist, he wishes to communicate this, his paschal, victorious love, to us. If we receive him with faith, we too can truly love God and neighbour; we can love as he loved us, by giving our life. If Christ’s love is within me, I can give myself fully to others, in the interior certainty that even if the other were to wound me I would not die; otherwise I should defend myself. The martyrs gave their own lives in this certainty of Christ’s victory over death. Only if we experience this power of Christ, the power of his love, are we truly free to give ourselves without fear. This is the Mass: to enter this passion, death, resurrection, ascension of Jesus; when we go to Mass it is as if were going to Calvary itself. But consider: whether at the moment of Mass we go to Calvary — let us ponder this with the imagination — and we know that that man there is Jesus. But will we allow ourselves to chat, to take photographs, to put on a little show? No! Because it is Jesus! We certainly pause in silence, in sorrow and also in the joy of being saved. As we enter the church to celebrate Mass, let us think about this: I am going to Calvary, where Jesus gave his life for me. In this way the spectacle disappears; the small talk disappears; the comments and these things that distance us from something so beautiful as the Mass, Jesus’ triumph. I think that it is clearer now how the Passover is made present and active each time we celebrate the Mass, which is the meaning of memorial. Taking part in the Eucharist enables us to enter the Paschal Mystery of Christ, giving ourselves to pass over with him from death to life, meaning there, on Calvary. The Mass is experiencing Calvary; it is not a spectacle.","pope":"Francis","type":"Audience","year":2017}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d88900a910b526c92c836"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Good morning! With today’s catechesis we shall conclude the cycle dedicated to mercy. Although the catecheses are finished, mercy must continue! Let us thank the Lord for all of this and let us keep it in our heart for consolation and comfort. The final spiritual work of mercy requires us to pray for the living and the dead. We can also place this alongside the last corporal work of mercy, which calls us to bury the dead. The latter may seem a curious request; and although, in certain regions of the world which are living under the scourge of war, with bombings day and night which sow fear and claim innocent victims, sadly this work is timely. The Bible gives a fine example in this regard: that of the elderly Tobit, who, risking his life, would bury the dead in spite of the king’s prohibition (cf. Tob 1:17-19, 2:2-4). Today too, there are those who risk their lives to bury unfortunate victims of war. Thus, this corporal work of mercy is not far from our daily existence. It makes us ponder what happened on Good Friday, when the Virgin Mary, along with John and several women were near Jesus’ Cross. After his death, Joseph of Arimathea — a rich member of the Sanhedrin, who had become a follower of Jesus — came and offered his tomb, newly hewn out of the rock, for Him. He personally went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body: a true work of mercy performed with great courage (cf. Mt 27:57-60)! For Christians, burial is an act of compassion, but also an act of great faith. We bury the bodies of our loved ones, in the hope of their resurrection (cf. 1 Cor 15:1-34). This is a rite that firmly endures and is heartfelt in our people, and which has a special resonance in this month of November which is dedicated in particular to prayer for the departed. Praying for the dead is, first and foremost, a sign of appreciation for the witness they have left us and the good that they have done. It is giving thanks to the Lord for having given them to us and for their love and their friendship. The Church prays for the deceased in a particular way during Holy Mass. The priest states: “Be mindful, O Lord, of thy servants who are gone before us with the sign of faith, and rest in sleep of peace. To these, O Lord, and to all that sleep in Christ, grant we beseech thee a place of refreshment, light and peace” (Roman Canon). It is a simple, effective, meaningful remembrance, because it entrusts our loved ones to God’s mercy. We pray with Christian hope that they may be with him in Paradise, as we wait to be together again in that mystery of love which we do not comprehend, but which we know to be true because it is a promise that Jesus made. We will all rise again and we will all be forever with Jesus, with Him. Remembering the faithful departed must not cause us to forget to also pray for the living, who together with us face the trials of life each day. The need for this prayer is even more evident if we place it in the light of the profession of faith which states: “I believe in the Communion of Saints”. It is the mystery which expresses the beauty of the mercy that Jesus revealed to us. The Communion of Saints, indeed, indicates that we are all immersed in God’s life and live in his love. All of us, living and dead, are in communion, that is, as a union; united in the community of those who have received Baptism, and of those who are nourished by the Body of Christ and form part of the great family of God. We are all the same family, united. For this reason we pray for each other. How many different ways there are to pray for our neighbour! They are all valid and accepted by God if done from the heart. I am thinking in a particular way of the mothers and fathers who bless their children in the morning and in the evening. There is still this practice in some families: blessing a child is a prayer. I think of praying for sick people, when we go to visit them and pray for them; of silent intercession, at times tearful, in the many difficult situations which require prayer. Yesterday a good man, an entrepreneur, came to Mass at Santa Marta. That young man must close his factory because he cannot manage, and he wept, saying: “I don’t want to leave more than 50 families without work. I could declare the company bankrupt: I could go home with my money, but my heart would weep for for these 50 families the rest of my life”. This is a good Christian who prays through his works: he came to Mass to pray that the Lord give him a way out, not only for him but for the 50 families. This is a man who knows how to pray, with his heart and through his deeds, he knows how to pray for his neighbour. He is in a difficult situation, and he is not seeking the easiest way out: “let them manage on their own”. This man is a Christian. It did me good to listen to him! Perhaps there are many like him today, at this time in which so many people are in difficulty because of a lack of work. However, I also think of giving thanks for the good news about a friend, a relative, a co-worker: “Thank you Lord, for this wonderful thing!”. This too is praying for others! Thanking the Lord when things go well. At times, as Saint Paul says, “we do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words” (Rom 8:26). It is the Spirit who prays in us. Therefore, let us open our heart, to enable the Holy Spirit, scrutinizing our deepest aspirations, to purify them and lead them to fulfillment. However, for us and for others, let us always ask that God’s will be done, as in the Our Father, because his will is surely the greatest good, the goodness of a Father who never abandons us: pray and let the Holy Spirit pray in us. This is beautiful in life: to pray, thanking and praising the Lord, asking for something, weeping when there are difficulties, like that man. But let the heart always be open to the Spirit, that he may pray in us, with us and for us. Concluding these catecheses on mercy, let us commit ourselves to pray for each other so that the corporal and spiritual works of mercy may become ever more the style of our life. The catecheses, as I said at the beginning, end here. We have covered the 14 works of mercy, but mercy continues and we must exercise it in these 14 ways. Thank you.","pope":"Francis","type":"Audience","year":2016}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d88be0a910b526c92c837"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Good morning! On Sunday the Holy Door was opened in the Cathedral of Rome, the Basilica of St John Lateran, and a Door of Mercy was opened in the Cathedral of every diocese of the world, and also in shrines and churches indicated by bishops. The Jubilee is throughout the world, not only in Rome. I wanted this sign of the Holy Door to be present in every particular Church, so that the Jubilee of Mercy could be an experience shared by each person. The Holy Year, therefore, has begun in the entire Church and is being celebrated in every diocese as in Rome. Also, the first Holy Door was opened in the very heart of Africa. Rome, of course, is the visible sign of universal communion. May this ecclesial communion become ever more intense, so that the Church may be the living sign of the Father’s love and mercy in the world. The date 8 December was also meant to highlight this need, by linking, separated by 50 years, the beginning of the Jubilee with the conclusion of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council. In fact, the Council contemplated and introduced the Church to the light of the mystery of communion. Scattered throughout the world and articulated in many particular Churches, however, it is always and only the one Church of Jesus Christ, the one that he wanted and for which he offered himself. The “one” Church that lives of the very communion of God. This mystery of communion, which makes the Church a sign of the Father’s love, grows and matures in our heart, when the love, which we recognize in the Cross of Christ and in which we immerse ourselves, enables us to love as we are loved by Him. It is an unending Love, which has the face of forgiveness and mercy. However, mercy and forgiveness must not remain as pleasant words, but must be made manifest in daily life. Loving and forgiving are tangible and visible signs that faith has transformed our hearts and allow us to express God’s very life in ourselves. Loving and forgiving as God loves and forgives. This is a programme of life that can know no interruptions or exceptions, but it pushes us always to go farther without ever tiring, with the certainty of being sustained by the paternal presence of God. This great sign of Christian life is then transformed into many other signs that are characteristic of the Jubilee. I think of those who will pass through one of the Holy Doors, which this year are the true Doors of Mercy. The Door points to Jesus himself, who said: “I am the door; if anyone enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture” (Jn 10:9). Passing through the Holy Door is the sign of our trust in the Lord Jesus who came not to judge but to save (cf. Jn 12:47). Be careful that no one rather swift or too shrewd tells you that you have to pay: no! Salvation is not paid for. Salvation is not bought. The Door is Jesus, and Jesus is gratis! He himself speaks about those who do not enter as they should, and he simply says that they are thieves and robbers. Again, be mindful: salvation is free. Passing through the Holy Door is a sign of the true conversion of our heart. When we pass through that Door it is good to remember that we must also keep the door of our heart wide open. I am before the Holy Door and I ask: “Lord, help me to thrust open the door of my heart!”. The Holy Year will not be very effective if the door of our heart does not allow the passage of Christ who urges us to go toward others, in order to bring him and his love. Thus, as the Holy Door stays open, because it is the sign of the welcome that God himself holds for us, may our door, that of the heart, also be always wide open so as to exclude no one. Not even he or she who bothers me: no one. Another important sign of the Jubilee is confession. Approaching the Sacrament by which we reconcile ourselves with God is equal to directly experiencing his mercy. It is finding the Father who forgives: God forgives everything. God understands us even in our limitations, and he even understands us in our contradictions. Not only this, but He tells us with his love that precisely when we recognize our sins he is even closer and he spurs us to look forward. He says even more: that when we recognize our sins and we ask for forgiveness, there is a celebration in Heaven. Jesus celebrates: this is his mercy: let us not be discouraged. Onward, forward with this! How often have I heard: “Father, I can’t forgive my neighbour, a coworker, the lady next door, my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law”. We have all heard this: “I can’t forgive”. But how can we ask God to forgive us, if we are unable to forgive? Forgiving is something great, yet forgiving is not easy, because our heart is poor and with its efforts alone we cannot do it. However, if we open ourselves up to welcome God’s mercy for ourselves, in turn we become capable of forgiveness. So often I have heard: “I couldn’t see that person: I hated her. But one day, I drew close to the Lord and I asked him to forgive my sins, and I forgave that person too”. These are everyday matters. And this opportunity is close to us. Therefore, take courage! Let us live out the Jubilee by beginning with these signs that carry the great power of love. The Lord will accompany us in order to lead us to experience other important signs for our life. Take courage and step forward!","pope":"Francis","type":"Audience","year":2015}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d88e90a910b526c92c838"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, Good morning! This Sunday marks the second stage of the Season of Advent, a marvelous time which reawakens in us the expectation of Christ’s return and the memory of his historical coming. Today’s Liturgy presents us with a message full of hope. It is the Lord’s express invitation from the lips of the Isaiah: “Comfort, comfort my people, says your God” (40:1). These words open the Book of Comfort, in which the Prophet addresses the joyous proclamation of liberation to the people in exile. The time of tribulation has ended; the people of Israel can look trustingly toward the future: at last they can return to their homeland. This is the reason for the invitation to let themselves be comforted by the Lord. Isaiah addresses people who have passed through a dark period, who have been subjected to a very difficult trial; but now the time of comfort has has come. Sorrow and fear can be replaced with joy, for the Lord himself will guide his people on the way to liberation and salvation. How will He do all this? With the solicitude and tenderness of a shepherd who takes care of his flock. He will in fact provide unity and security and feed his flock, gather the lost sheep into his sure fold, reserve special attention to the most fragile and weak (v. 11). This is God’s attitude toward us, his creatures. For this reason, the Prophet invites those who hear him — including us, today — to spread this message of hope: that the Lord consoles us. And to make room for the comfort which comes from the Lord. We cannot be messengers of God’s comfort if we do not first feel the joy of being comforted and loved by Him. This happens especially when we hear his Word, the Gospel, which we should carry in our pocket: do not forget this! The Gospel in your pocket or purse, to read regularly. And this gives us comfort: when we abide in silent prayer in his presence, when we encounter Him in the Eucharist or in the Sacrament of Reconciliation. All this comforts us. Let us therefore allow Isaiah’s call — “Comfort, comfort my people” — resound in our heart in this Season of Advent. Today there is need for people to be witnesses to the mercy and tenderness of God, who spurs the resigned, enlivens the disheartened, ignites the fire of hope. He ignites the fire of hope! We don’t. So many situations require our comforting witness. To be joyful, comforting people. I am thinking of those who are burdened by suffering, injustice and tyranny; of those who are slaves to money, to power, to success, to worldliness. Poor dears! They have fabricated consolation, not the true comfort of the Lord! We are all called to comfort our brothers and sisters, to testify that God alone can eliminate the causes of existential and spiritual tragedies. He can do it! He is powerful! Isaiah’s message, which resounds in this second Sunday of Advent, is a salve on our wounds and an impetus to prepare with commitment the way of the Lord. Indeed, today the Prophet speaks to heart to tell us that God condones our sins and comforts us. If we entrust ourselves to Him with a humble and penitent heart, He will tear down the walls of evil, He will fill in the holes of our omissions, He will smooth over the bumps of arrogance and vanity, and will open the way of encounter with Him. It is curious, but many times we are afraid of consolation, of being comforted. Or rather, we feel more secure in sorrow and desolation. Do you know why? Because in sorrow we feel almost as protagonists. However, in consolation the Holy Spirit is the protagonist! It is He who consoles us, it is He who gives us the courage to go out of ourselves. It is He who opens the door to the source of every true comfort, that is, the Father. And this is conversion. Please, let yourselves be comforted by the Lord! Let yourselves be comforted by the Lord! The Virgin Mary is the “Way” that God Himself prepared in order to come into the world. Le us entrust to Her the salvation and peace awaited by all men and women of our time.

The Year of Faith, which concluded yesterday, was a providential occasion for believers to rekindle the flame of faith, that flame which was entrusted to us on the day of our Baptism so that we might guard and share it. During this special Year, you have generously given of your time and abilities especially to serve the spiritual journeys of the various groups of faithful that were proposed through suitable pastoral initiatives. On behalf of the Church I thank all of you and together let us thank the Lord for all the good that he has given us to accomplish. In this time of grace we have been able to rediscover the essence of the Christian journey, in which faith, together with charity, has first place. Faith, in fact, is the cornerstone of the Christian experience because it motivates the decisions and actions of our daily lives. Faith is the inexhaustible wellspring of all our actions within our families, at work, in the parish, with friends and in various social situations. And we see this steadfast and genuine faith especially in moments of difficulty and trial. It is then that the Christian allows himself to be taken into God’s arms and that he clings to him with the assurance of entrusting himself to a love as strong as an indestructible rock. We are able to offer a good witness precisely in these situations of suffering, if we abandon ourselves to God with humility. Dear friends, your precious volunteer service at the various events of the Year of Faith has given you the opportunity to understand better than others the enthusiasm of the various groups of people who were involved. Together we must truly praise the Lord for the spiritual intensity and apostolic ardour brought forth by the many pastoral initiatives in these months in Rome, and all over the world. Let us be witnesses that faith in Christ can warm hearts, thus becoming a true driving force for the new evangelization. A faith lived deeply and with conviction tends to open itself to proclaiming the Gospel far and wide. It is faith that makes our communities missionary! Indeed we need Christian communities committed to a courageous apostolate that reaches people where they are, even in the most difficult situations. Your experience during the Year of Faith will first help all of you to open yourselves and your communities to an encounter with others. This is important, I would say essential! Especially to open yourselves to those whose lives are are poorest in faith and hope. We speak a lot about poverty, but we do not always think about those who are poor in faith: there are many. There are many people who need of an act of human kindness, a smile or a true word, a witness by which they may grasp the closeness of Jesus Christ. May this sign of love and tenderness which is born from faith be lacking to no one. I thank you again and I invoke upon you and your families the blessing of the Lord.","pope":"Francis","type":"Speech","year":2013}

Following the Apostle’s example, as your brother in the faith, I too “bow my knees before the Father” (Eph 3:14) to ask him to grant that you “be strengthened with might through his Spirit” (v. 16), and, “to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge” (v. 19). The exchange of Delegations between the Church of Rome and the Church of Constantinople, which takes place every year on the occasion of the respective patronal feasts of St Andrew in the Phanar and Sts Peter and Paul in Rome, is a tangible testimony of the bond of brotherly closeness that unites us. Even though it is still imperfect, it is a profound and real communion that is not based on human reasons of courtesy or suitability, but on our common faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose Gospel of salvation came to us through the preaching and witness of the Apostles which was sealed by the blood of martyrdom. Relying on these sound foundations, we are able to advance confidently together on the path that leads towards the reestablishment of full communion. We have made great progress on this route Your Holiness, thanks too to your assiduous and active support for which I am deeply grateful. Although it seems that we still have a long and difficult way to go, our intention to continue in this direction remains firm, since we are comforted by the prayer our Lord Jesus Christ addressed to the Father: “that they may all be one.... in us, so that the world may believe” (Jn 17:21). Your Holiness, I wish at this moment to renew to you the expression of my deep gratitude for the words you spoke at the end of the celebration for the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council and the opening of the Year of Faith, which was held in Rome in October. Through these words you were able to interpret the sentiments of everyone present. I cherish vivid memories of your visit to Rome for this occasion, during which we had the opportunity to renew our ties of sincere and genuine friendship. This sincere friendship which has been born between us — with a great common vision of the responsibilities to which we are called as Christians and as Pastors of the flock that God has entrusted to us — is the reason for the great hope that an ever closer collaboration will develop in the urgent task of giving fresh vigour to our witness to the Gospel Message in today’s world. In addition, I warmly thank you, Your Holiness, and the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate for sending a Fraternal Delegate to take part in the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the theme: “The New Evangelization for the Transmission of the Christian Faith”. We have long been in full agreement with Your Holiness on the most urgent challenge today: how to bring the proclamation of God’s merciful love to the people of our time, so often distracted and more or less incapable of profound reflection on the actual meaning of their existence, seen in the light of projects and utopias that cannot but leave them disappointed. The Church has no other message than “the gospel of God” (Rom 1:1) and no other method than apostolic proclamation, sustained and guaranteed by the witness to holiness of life of both the Pastors and People of God. The Lord Jesus told us that “the harvest is plentiful” (Lk 10:2) and we cannot allow it to be lost because of our weaknesses and division. Your Holiness, in the divine Liturgy which you have celebrated today in honour of St Andrew, Patron of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, you prayed “for peace throughout the world, for the prosperity of the Holy Churches of God and for the union of all”. I join in your prayer with all the Catholic brothers and sisters. The full communion to which we all aspire is a gift that comes from God. Let us confidently address our plea to him “who by the power at work within us is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think” (Eph 3:20), through the intercession of St Andrew and of St Peter, his brother. With these sentiments of sincere affection in Christ the Lord, I renew my warm good wishes and exchange with Your Holiness a brotherly embrace.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Message","year":2012}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d898e0a910b526c92c83b"},"text":"To my Venerable Brother Metropolitan Archbishop Antonio Arregui Yarza of Guayaquil President of the Bishops’ Conference of Ecuador On the occasion of the Second National Congress for the Family I greet with affection the pastors and faithful of the Church in Ecuador, which — in the context of the Continental Mission, proposed by the Latin American and Caribbean Bishops’ Conferences at Aparecida, and in preparation for the Seventh World Meeting for Families that will take place in Milan — will seek to begin a process of reflection on the Gospel that will enable married Christians and their homes to respond to their identity, vocation and mission. The theme of the Congress, “The Ecuadorian Family on Mission: Work and Rest at the Service of the Individual and of the Common Good”, recognizes that the family, born from the covenant of love and of the total and sincere reciprocal gift of a man and a woman in marriage, is not a private affair, closed in on itself. By its vocation it carries out a marvellous service, crucial to the good of society and to the Church’s mission. In fact, society is not the mere sum of individuals but rather the fruit of relationships between people: between husband and wife, parents and children, and between siblings, relationships which are founded on family life and the bonds of love that stem from it. Through children each family gives society the human riches it has experienced. It can rightly be said that the health and quality of social relations depend on the health and quality of family relationships. In this regard, work and rest especially concern and are deeply bound to family life: they condition its decisions, influence relationships between the spouses and between parents and children and affect the family’s ties with society and with the Church. Through work, human beings experience themselves as subjects who share in God’s plan of creation. Hence the lack of work and its precariousness threaten human dignity. Not only do they create situations of injustice and poverty that degenerate all too often into despair, crime and violence but they even cause people to have an identity crisis. It is, therefore, urgent to find effective measures, serious and appropriate projects, as well as the necessary determination to find ways to enable all to have access to a dignified, permanent and well paid job. This will enable them to be sanctified and to play an active role in the development of society, combining hard and responsible work with sufficient time for a rich, fruitful and harmonious family life. A serene and constructive home atmosphere, with its domestic duties and affections, is the first school of work and the best place for people to discover their potential, increase their eagerness to improve themselves and to achieve their noblest aspirations. Furthermore, family life teaches people to overcome selfishness, to foster solidarity, not to scorn sacrifice for the happiness of others, to value what is good and upright and to apply themselves with conviction and generosity for the benefit of the commonweal and for each other’s good, inasmuch as they are responsible for themselves, for others and for the surrounding context. Rest, for its part, humanizes time by opening it to the encounter with God, with others and with nature. It follows that families need to recover the genuine feeling of rest, especially on Sunday, the Day of the Lord and of man. In the celebration of Sunday Mass the family experiences here and now the Real Presence of the Risen Lord, receives new life, welcomes the gift of the Spirit, increases its love for the Church, listens to God’s word, shares the Eucharistic Bread and opens to brotherly love. With these sentiments, while I renew the expression of my closeness and cordiality to the most beloved sons and daughters of this nation, I entrust the results of this Congress to the powerful intercession of Nuestra Señora de la Presentación del Quinché, the heavenly Patroness of Ecuador. As a pledge of abundant divine favours, I gladly impart to everyone present the implored Apostolic Blessing.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Message","year":2011}

In these intense days, you wish to focus your attention on the theme: \"The Rule of Life, an expression of consecration, a guarantee of the charismatic identity, support of fraternal communion, a mission project\". You are intending to review and approve your Institute's Constitutions and Norms to bring them into line especially with the new ecclesial sensibility that resulted from the Second Vatican Council and is codified in the Code of Canon Law in force today. This commitment has a special importance since it is a question of presenting to the entire Religious Family reference texts to which each one must conform his own experience of fraternal and apostolic life to be an eloquent sign of God's love and an instrument of salvation in every context. May God bless your resolutions! For them to be fruitful it is necessary that you faithfully preserve the spiritual patrimony handed down to you by your Founder, St Hannibal Mary Di Francia, who had an intense love for Christ and always drew inspiration from him in carrying out an effective vocations apostolate, as well as courageous work for his needy neighbour. Follow his example and joyfully carry on his mission that is still valid today, in spite of the different social conditions in which we live. In particular, spread increasingly his spirit of prayer and of concern for all the vocations in the Church; may you be painstaking labourers for the coming of the Kingdom of God, expending all your energy on evangelization and on human advancement. Today the great challenge of inculturation requires that you proclaim the Good News in languages and ways that can be understood by the people of our time, involved in rapidly changing social and cultural processes. Consequently the field of the apostolate open before you is vast! Like your Founder, give your life for those who \"thirst\" for hope, cultivate an authentic passion for education, above all for youth, expend yourselves in generous pastoral activity among people, especially for those who are suffering in body and mind. In this regard I would like to recall what I said recently, as it were, to sum up the Year for Priests: \"Every Pastor, therefore, is a means through whom Christ himself loves men: it is through our ministry, dear priests, it is through us that the Lord reaches souls, instructs, guards and guides them\" (General Audience Catechism, 26 May 2010). Your Congregation boasts a long history, written by courageous witnesses of Christ and of his Gospel. Today you are called to walk on this path with renewed zeal, to impel yourselves, with prophetic freedom and wise discernment on hazardous apostolic roads and missionary frontiers, fostering close collaboration with the Bishops and with the other members of the Ecclesial Community. The vast horizons of evangelization and the urgent need to witness to the Gospel Message to all, without distinction, constitute the field of your apostolate. A great many people are still waiting to know Jesus, the one Redeemer of man, and many situations of injustice and moral and material hardship are calling believers into question. Such an urgent mission demands ceaseless personal and community conversion. Only hearts that are fully open to the action of Grace are able to interpret the signs of the times and understand the cries of humanity in need of hope and peace. In the various fields of your ecclesial service, faithful adherence to Christ and to his Gospel shines out. May the Blessed Virgin, Queen of vocations and Mother of priests, protect you, help you and be a reliable guide to you on the journey of your Religious Family, so that it may bring to fruition its every project of good. With these hopes, while I assure my affectionate remembrance in prayer to each one of you and for the work of your Chapter, I cordially impart my Blessing which I willingly extend to all the Rogationists, to the Daughters of Divine Zeal and to everyone you meet in your daily apostolate.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Message","year":2010}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8a7d0a910b526c92c83d"},"text":"To Archbishop Julián Barrio Barrio of Santiago de Compostela For the opening of the Holy Door which inaugurates the Jubilee of Santiago de Compostela of 2010, I extend a cordial greeting to you, Your Excellency, and to the participants in this important ceremony, as well as to the pastors and faithful of this particular Church which by its immemorial bond with the Apostle James is deeply rooted in the Gospel of Christ, offering this spiritual treasure to his children and to the pilgrims who come from Galicia, from other parts of Spain, from Europe and from the furthest corners of the world. This solemn act opens a special season of grace and forgiveness, the season of the \"Great Pardon\", as it is called by tradition. It is a special opportunity for believers to reflect on their genuine vocation to holiness of life, to be imbued with the word of God that enlightens and challenges them and to recognize Christ who comes to meet them, accompanies them in the vicissitudes of their journey in the world and gives himself to them personally, especially in the Eucharist. However, even those who have no faith or who perhaps have let it wither, will have a special opportunity to receive the gift given by \"him who enlightens all men that they may at length have life\" (Lumen Gentium, n. 16). Santiago de Compostela has long been distinguished as a very important destination for pilgrims, whose steps have marked out a Way which is called after the Apostle to whose tomb people come especially from the most diverse regions of Europe to renew and strengthen their faith. It is a Way sown with so many demonstrations of fervour, repentance, hospitality, art and culture which speak to us eloquently of the spiritual roots of the Old Continent. The motto of this new Compostelian Jubilee Year, \"On Pilgrimage Towards the Light\", and the Pastoral Letter for the occasion, \"Pilgrims of Faith and Witnesses of the Risen Christ\", faithfully follow this tradition and present it anew to the men and women of today as a call for evangelization, recalling the essentially pilgrim character of the Church and of being Christians in this world (cf. Lumen Gentium, n. 6, 48-50). On the Way, new horizons are contemplated that prompt one to reflect on the narrowness of one's own life and the immensity that the human being has within him and outside him, preparing him to go in search of what his heart truly yearns for. Open to wonder and to transcendence, the pilgrim lets himself be instructed by the word of God, and in this way cleanses his faith from unfounded attachments and fears. This is what the Risen Lord did with the disciples who, dazed and downhearted, were on their way to Emmaus. When he added to his words the gesture of breaking the bread, the disciples' \"eyes were opened\" (Lk 24: 31) and they recognized him whom they thought had been overcome by death. So they had a personal encounter with Christ, who lives for ever and is part of their lives. At that moment, their first and most ardent wish was to proclaim and tell the others what had happened (cf. Lk 24: 35). I fervently ask the Lord to accompany the pilgrims, to make himself known and to enter their hearts, \"so that they may have life, and have it abundantly\" (Jn 10: 10). This is the true objective, grace, which merely walking the Way alone cannot enable one to achieve and which leads the pilgrim to become a witness to others of the fact that Christ lives and is our eternal hope of salvation. In this Archdiocese, together with many other ecclesial organizations, many pastoral projects have been implemented to contribute to reaching this essential goal of the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, of a spiritual character, although in some cases there is a tendency to ignore or distort it. In this Holy Year, in tune with the Year for Priests, a decisive role must be played by priests, whose spirit of acceptance and dedication to the faithful and to pilgrims must be especially generous. Pilgrims themselves, they are called to serve their brothers and sisters, offering them the life of God, as men of the divine word and of sacred things (cf. To The International Retreat for Priests in Ars, 28 September 2009). I then encourage the priests of this Archdiocese, as well as those who will join them during this Jubilee and those of the dioceses through which the Way passes, to do their utmost in the administration of the sacraments of penance and of the Eucharist, since the most sought-after and characteristic benefit of the Holy Year is the Pardon and the encounter with the living Christ. In this circumstance, I express my special closeness to the pilgrims who have come and who will continue to come to Santiago. I ask them to treasure the evocative experiences of faith, charity and brotherhood that they meet with their journey, to experience the Way especially inwardly, letting themselves be challenged by the call that the Lord makes to each one of them. Thus they will be able to say joyfully and firmly at the Portico of Glory: \"I believe\". I ask them also not to forget in their prayers those who could not accompany them, their families and friends, the sick and the needy, emigrants, people with a wavering faith and the People of God with their Pastors. I cordially thank the Archdiocese of Santiago as well as the Authorities and the other collaborators, for their efforts in preparing this Jubilee of Compostela, and also the volunteers and all those who are prepared to contribute to its smooth functioning. I entrust the spiritual and pastoral fruits of this Holy Year to our Mother in Heaven, the Pilgrim Virgin, to the Apostle James, the \"friend of the Lord\", and at the same time I impart the Apostolic Blessing to all with affection.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Message","year":2009}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8af60a910b526c92c83e"},"text":"To Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran President of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi President of the Pontifical Council for Culture I would like first of all to express my great satisfaction in the combined initiative of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and the Pontifical Council for Culture, which have desired to organize a Study Day on the theme: Culture and Religions in Dialogue through which the Holy See participates at the European Union's project, approved in December 2006, declaring the year 2008 the \"European Year of Intercultural Dialogue\". Together with the Presidents of the above-mentioned Pontifical Councils, I cordially greet the Cardinals, my venerable Brothers in the Episcopate, the distinguished Members of the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See, as well as the Representatives of various Religions and all who are taking part in this important meeting. For many years Europe has been aware of its essential cultural unity, despite the constellation of national cultures that shaped its countenance. It is good to emphasize that contemporary Europe, which begins its venture into the Third Millennium, is the product of two millennia of civilization. It is deeply rooted in the large and ancient patrimony of Athens and Rome and in the fertile terrain of Christianity, which proved capable of creating new cultural heritages while at the same time receiving the original contribution of every civilization. The new humanism that emerged from the dissemination of the Gospel message exalts all the elements worthy of the human person and of his transcendent vocation, purifying them from the dross that obscures the authentic face of man created in the image and likeness of God. Thus Europe today appears to us as a precious cloth whose fabric is woven from the principles and values spun from the Gospel, while the national cultures have been able to embroider it with an immense variety of perspectives that express the religious, intellectual, technical, scientific and artistic abilities of the Homo europeus. In this sense, we may affirm that Europe has had and still has a cultural influence on the entire human race, and cannot fail to feel particularly responsible not only for its own future but also for the future of humanity as a whole. In today's context, in which our contemporaries ask themselves ever more often the essential questions on the meaning of life and its value, it appears more important than ever to reflect on the ancient roots from which abundant sap has flowed in the course of centuries. The theme of intercultural and interreligious dialogue, therefore, is emerging as a priority for the European Union and transversally concerns the sectors of culture and communication, of education and science, of migration and of minorities, reaching as far as the sectors of youth and of work. Once diversity has been accepted as a positive factor, it is necessary to ensure that people not only accept the existence of other cultures but also desire to be enriched by them. In a discourse to Catholics, my Predecessor, the Servant of God Paul VI, spelled out his deep conviction in these words: \"The Church must enter into dialogue with the world in which she lives. She has something to say, a message to give, a communication to make\" (Encyclical Ecclesiam suam, n. 65). We live in what is usually called a \"pluralistic world\", characterized by the speed of communications, the mobility of peoples and their economic, political and cultural interdependence. Precisely in this period, at times dramatic, even if many Europeans unfortunately seem to ignore Europe's Christian roots, they are alive and should trace the path and nourish the hope of millions of citizens who share the same values. Thus may believers always be ready to promote initiatives of intercultural and interreligious dialogue, in order to encourage collaboration on themes of mutual interest, such as the dignity of the human person, the search for the common good, the building of peace, and development. In this regard the Holy See has given special importance to its own participation in the high-level dialogue on understanding among religions and cultures and on cooperation for peace, within the framework of the 62nd General Assembly of the United Nations (4-5 October 2007). If it is to be authentic, such a dialogue must avoid sinking into relativism and syncretism and must be inspired by sincere respect for others and by a generous spirit of reconciliation and fraternity. I encourage all who are dedicated to building a Europe that is welcoming, supportive and increasingly faithful to its roots. In particular, I exhort believers not only to contribute to jealously guarding the cultural and spiritual heritage that distinguishes them and is an integral part of their history, but also to be more committed to seeking new ways to face adequately the great challenges that mark the post-modern epoch. Among these, I limit myself to mentioning the defence of human life in each of its stages, the safeguard of all human and family rights, the building of a just and solidary world, respect for creation, and intercultural and interreligious dialogue. In this prospective, I express my good wishes for the success of the planned Study Day, and invoke upon all of the participants an abundance of God's Blessings.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Message","year":2008}

{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8b360a910b526c92c840"},"text":"To My Beloved Brother Bishops, Priests, and Lay Faithful in the Middle East Bathed in the light of Christmas, we contemplate the presence of the Word who has pitched his tent among us. He is the “light that shines in the darkness” and that “gave us power to become children of God” (cf. Jn 1:5, 12). At this most significant time for the Christian faith, I wish to address a special word to you, Catholic brothers and sisters, who live in the Middle East region: I feel spiritually present in each of your particular Churches, even the smallest, sharing with you the worries and the hope with which you await the Lord Jesus, Prince of Peace. To all of you I say with the biblical greeting used by Saint Francis of Assisi: may the Lord give you peace. I greet with affection the communities that are, or feel like, a “little flock” either due to the diminished numbers of their brothers and sisters (cf. Lk 12:32), or because they are immersed in a society composed of a majority of believers from other religions, or due to the serious hardships and difficulties being currently experienced by some of the nations in this area. I am thinking above all of countries marked by strained relations and often marred by brutally violent incidents which, as well as causing widespread destruction, strike without pity helpless and innocent people. The daily news coming from the Middle East shows a growth of alarming situations, seemingly with no possible escape. They are events which naturally give rise, in those involved, to recriminations and rage, leading them to thoughts of retaliation and revenge. We know that these are not Christian sentiments; to give in to them would leave us callous and spiteful, far from that “gentleness and lowliness” which Jesus Christ proposed to us as the model of behaviour (cf. Mt 11:29). Indeed, we could lose the opportunity to make a properly Christian contribution to the solution of the grave problems of our time. It would not be at all wise, especially now, to spend our time asking who has suffered the most or presenting an account of injustices suffered, listing the reasons which reinforce one’s own argument. This has often happened in the past, with results which to say the least were disappointing. Suffering in the end affects everyone, and when one person suffers he should first of all wish to understand how much someone else in a similar situation suffers. Patient and humble dialogue, achieved through listening to each other and being intent upon understanding someone else’s situation has already born positive results in many countries previously devastated by violence and revenge. A little more trust in the compassion of others, especially those suffering, cannot but bear efficacious results. Today, many parties rightly plead for this interior disposition. The Catholic communities in your countries are never far from my thoughts and in this season of Christmas I think of them with a heightened sense of concern. The star seen by the Magi brings us to your lands, the star which guided them to see the child with Mary his mother (cf. Mt 2:11). It is in the East that Jesus offered his life and “made the two into one, and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility” (Eph 2:14). There he said to his disciples: “Go into the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation” (Mk 16:15). There the Master’s disciples were for the first time called Christians (cf. Acts 11:26). There the Church of the great Fathers was born and grew, and varying and rich spiritual and liturgical traditions blossomed. To you, dear brothers and sisters, heirs of these traditions, I express with affection my personal closeness in this situation of human insecurity, daily suffering, fear and hope which you are living. I repeat to your communities the words of the Redeemer: “Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give to you the kingdom” (Lk 12:32). You can rely on my full solidarity with you in your current circumstances. In this regard, I am sure that I speak for the universal Church. Thus neither individual Catholics nor their communities, should feel alone or abandoned. Your Churches are accompanied in their difficult journey by prayer and by the charitable support of the particular Churches throughout the whole world, according to the example and spirit of the early Church (cf. Acts 11:29-30). In the present circumstances, marked little by light and too much by darkness, it is a cause of consolation and hope for me to know that the Christian communities in the Middle East, whose intense suffering I am well aware of, continue to be vital and active communities, resolute in bearing witness to their faith with their specific identity in the societies in which they are situated. They wish to contribute in a constructive manner to the urgent needs of their respective societies and the whole region. Saint Peter, writing his First Letter to a rather poor and marginalized community, persecuted and held in little regard by the society of that time, did not hesitate to say that that their difficult situation should be considered a “grace” (cf. 1 Pt 1:7-11). In fact, is it not a grace to be able to participate in the sufferings of Christ, uniting oneself to the action with which he took unto himself our sins in order to atone for them? May Catholic communities, often living in difficult situations, be aware of the powerful force which emanates from suffering accepted with love. Such suffering can change the hearts of others and the heart of the world. I encourage each of you therefore to carry on with perseverance, comforted by the knowledge of the “price” with which Christ has redeemed us (cf. 1 Cor 6:20). Certainly, the response to one’s Christian vocation is much more difficult for the members of minority communities, often numerically of little significance. Nevertheless, as your Patriarchs wrote in their Pastoral Letter of Easter 1992, “the light can be faint in a house yet lighten up the whole house. Salt is a negligible element in foods, but it is salt which gives them flavour. Very little yeast is in dough, yet it is the leaven which prepares it to become bread.” In making these words my own I encourage the Catholic Bishops to persevere in their ministry, cultivating unity among themselves and always remaining close to their flock. Know that the Pope shares the concerns, hopes and exhortations expressed in their annual pastoral letters, and also in the daily exercise of their sacred duties. He encourages them in their effort to sustain and reinforce in faith, hope and charity the flock entrusted to them. The presence of their communities in the various countries of the region constitutes, among other things, something which can greatly encourage ecumenism. For some time now it has become clear that many Christians are leaving the Middle East, to such an extent that the Holy Places are at risk of being reduced to archaeological sites, void of any ecclesial life. Undoubtedly, minorities find it difficult to survive in the midst of dangerous geopolitical situations, cultural conflicts, economic and strategic interests, and forms of aggression which claim justification from a social or religious basis. In fact, many Christians eventually give in to the temptation to emigrate. Often the damage done is practically irreparable. One must not forget, however, that simply being together and living through common suffering has a healing effect on wounds and disposes people to thoughts and deeds of reconciliation and peace. This in turn gives rise to a habitual, fraternal dialogue, which in time and with the grace of the Holy Spirit, can become a broader dialogue in the cultural, social and political spheres. Believers moreover are confidently aware of a hope that does not delude, because it is rooted in the presence of the Risen One. From him comes the commitment of faith and our active love of neighbour (cf. 1 Th 1:3). Even in the most distressing situations Christian hope teaches us that passive resignation and pessimism are the great threat which can thwart the unfolding of our baptismal vocation. They bring about distrust, fear, self-pity, fatalism and flight. In the present situation Christians are called to be courageous and steadfast in the power of the Spirit of Christ, knowing that they can count on the closeness of their brothers and sisters in the faith scattered throughout the world. Saint Paul, writing to the Romans, declares that there is no comparison between the sufferings of this present time and the future glory that awaits us (cf. 8:18). Likewise Saint Peter, in his First Letter reminds us that we Christians, even when afflicted by various trials, have a higher hope that fills our heart with joy (cf. 1:6). Saint Paul again, in the Second Letter to the Corinthians states with conviction that “the God of all consolation… comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction” (1:3-4). We know well that the consolation promised by the Holy Spirit does not consist merely of nice words, but in a broadening of mind and heart, that allows us to understand our own situation in the wider picture of all creation labouring in the act of giving birth while awaiting the revelation of the sons of God (cf. Rom 8:19-25). From this perspective it is possible to think more of our neighbour’s sufferings than of our own, more of common ills than private ones. We can strive to do something so that others may understand that their sufferings are recognized and understood, and that we have the will, as far as possible, to remedy them. Through you, my dearly beloved, I wish to make an appeal to your fellow citizens, men and women of the different Christian confessions, of different religions and all who honestly seek peace, justice and solidarity by listening and sincere dialogue. I say to you all: persevere with courage and trust! I appeal to those who hold positions of responsibility in guiding events to cultivate that sensitivity, attentiveness and closeness which surpasses schemes and strategies so that they can build societies that are more peaceful and just, truly respectful of every human being. You are well aware, dear brothers and sisters, of my ardent desire that Providence will allow me to make a pilgrimage to the Land made holy by the events of Salvation History. I hope to be able to pray in Jerusalem, “the cherished homeland of all the spiritual descendants of Abraham, who hold it so dearly” (cf. John Paul II, Redemptionis Anno, AAS LXXVI, 1984, 625). I am convinced that it can rise up as “a symbol of encounter, of union and peace for the whole human family” (ibid p. 629). While we await the fulfilment of this desire, I encourage you to continue along the path of trust, with acts of friendship and good will. I refer both to the simple, daily deeds practiced for years in your region by so many good and humble people who have always treated others with consideration, and also to those deeds considered heroic, inspired by authentic respect for human dignity and the desire to find solutions to situations of grave hostility. Peace is such an important and urgent good that it warrants great sacrifices on the part of all. As my venerable predecessor, Pope John Paul II, wrote: “there is no peace without justice”. It is necessary therefore that the rights of all be recognized and upheld. Pope John Paul II however added: “there is no peace without forgiveness”. Agreements opening the way to dialogue and future cooperation are not normally reached without coming to terms with past errors. In this case forgiveness is an indispensable condition if we wish to be free to build a new future. Works of solidarity are born and developed from forgiveness offered and received. Many such initiatives have already been undertaken in your region by the Church, governments and non-governmental organizations. The song of the Angels over the stable of Bethlehem – “peace on earth to those whom God loves” – takes on during these days its full meaning and produces now those fruits that in eternal life will exist fully. I hope that the Christmas season will be marked by an end to or at least a reprieve from so much suffering. May it give to families that extra hope which is necessary to persevere in the arduous task of promoting peace in a world so wounded and divided. Dear brothers and sisters, be assured that along this path you are accompanied by the fervent prayers of the Pope and the whole Church. May the intercession and example of so many martyrs and saints, who have given courageous witness to Christ in your lands, sustain and strengthen you in your faith. And may the Holy Family of Nazareth watch over your worthy resolutions and commitments. With these sentiments, I cordially impart to each one of you a special Apostolic Blessing as a pledge of my affection and closeness.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Message","year":2006}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8b710a910b526c92c841"},"text":"Dear young Friends, I would like to send my cordial greetings to you all, gathered in Nieuwegein for the First National Day of Young Catholics of The Netherlands. I greet Cardinal Adrianus Simonis, Archbishop of Utrecht and President of the Bishops' Conference, and all the Dutch Bishops, expressing deep appreciation for the organization of this propitious initiative. I would then like to thank the Werkgroep Katholieke Jongeren for its work in these years and the priests and lay people involved in the pastoral care of youth, who are following you in your reflection. With this Message, dear young people, I wish to make myself spiritually present among you and to assure you that I accompany you in prayer. I know that a great many of you took part in the World Meeting at Cologne and it therefore gives me great joy that you now want to continue the experience that began with World Youth Day, involving others of your age who did not have the grace to take part in it. Holding today's meeting at the invitation of your Bishops is a very beautiful sign for Dutch society: it means that you are not afraid to say that you are Christians and want to witness to it openly. In fact, the deepest reason for your gathering together is to encounter the Lord Jesus Christ. This is how it was for those who took part in the recent World Youth Day, whose theme was: \"We have come to worship him\" (Mt 2: 2). In the footsteps of the Magi, impelled by the yearning to seek the truth, young people from every corner of the earth met in Cologne to seek and worship God made Man, and then, transformed by their encounter with him and illumined by his presence, they returned to their country, like the Magi, \"by another route\" (Mt 2: 12). So it was that you returned to Holland, eager to communicate to one and all your rich experience, and today you want to share it with your peers. Dear friends, Jesus is your true friend and Lord; enter into a relationship of true friendship with him! He is expecting you and in him alone will you find happiness. How easy it is to be content with the superficial pleasures that daily life offers us; how easy it is to live only for oneself, apparently enjoying life! But sooner or later we realize that this is not true happiness, because true happiness is much deeper: we find it only in Jesus. As I said in Cologne, \"The happiness you are seeking, the happiness you have a right to enjoy, has a name and a face: it is Jesus of Nazareth\" (Address at the Poller Rheinwiesen Wharf, 18 August 2005; L'Osservatore Romano English edition, 24 August, p. 4). I therefore invite you every day to seek the Lord, who wants nothing more than for you to be truly happy. Foster an intense and constant relationship with him in prayer and, when possible, find suitable moments in your day to be alone in his company. If you do not know how to pray, ask him to teach you, and ask your heavenly Mother to pray with you and for you. The recitation of the Rosary can help you learn the art of prayer with Mary's simplicity and depth. It is important that you make participation in the Eucharist, in which Jesus gives himself for us, the heart of your life. He who died for the sins of all desires to enter into communion with each one of you and is knocking at the doors of your hearts to give you his grace. Go to the encounter with him in the Blessed Eucharist, go to adore him in the churches, kneeling before the Tabernacle: Jesus will fill you with his love and will reveal to you the thoughts of his Heart. If you listen to him, you will feel ever more deeply the joy of belonging to his Mystical Body, the Church, which is the family of his disciples held close by the bond of unity and love. You will also learn, as the Apostle Paul says, to let yourselves be reconciled with God (cf. II Cor 5: 20). Especially in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, Jesus waits for you to forgive you your sins and reconcile you with his love through the ministry of the priest. By confessing your sins humbly and truthfully, you will receive the pardon of God himself through the words of his minister. What a great opportunity the Lord has given us with this sacrament to renew ourselves from within and to progress in our Christian life! I recommend that you make good use of it all the time! Dear friends, as I said to you above, if you follow Jesus, you will never feel lonely because you are part of the Church, which is a great family in which you can grow in true friendship with so many brothers and sisters in the faith scattered in every part of the world. Jesus needs you to \"renew\" contemporary society. Take care to grow in the knowledge of the faith in order to be its authentic witnesses. Dedicate yourselves to understanding Catholic doctrine ever better: even if at times in looking at it with the eyes of the world it may seem a difficult message to accept, in it is the answer that satisfies your basic questions. Trust your Pastors and guides, Bishops and priests; become actively involved in the parishes, movements, associations and Ecclesial Communities to experience together the joy of being followers of Christ, who proclaims and gives truth and love. And truly impelled by his truth and love, you will be able, together with other young people who are seeking the true meaning of life, to build a better future for all. Dear friends, I am close to you with my prayers. May you generously accept the call of the Lord, who holds up to you great ideals that can make your lives beautiful and full of joy. You can be certain of it: only by responding positively to his appeal, however demanding it may seem to you, is it possible to find happiness and peace of heart. May the Virgin Mary accompany you on this journey of Christian commitment, and may she help you in all your good resolutions. With these sentiments, I cordially impart a special Apostolic Blessing to all of you who are gathered in Nieuwegein, as well as to those who accompany you with love and wisdom on your path of human and spiritual growth.","pope":"Benedict XVI","type":"Message","year":2005}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8bdf0a910b526c92c842"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, 1. I would like to extend my cordial greeting to you all, called by God with a special vocation to follow Christ more closely. At the end of the World Congress on Consecrated Life that has been taking place during these days in Rome, it is a cause of joy for me to be able to send a special Message to all of you who have been taking part: to the Presidents of the men's and women's Conferences of Major Superiors, to the men and women Superiors General and to all of you, consecrated men and women, who have gathered here in these days to question yourselves on the problems and prospects that characterize your choice of life today. 2. The hearts of our contemporaries are sometimes impoverished by no longer being able to assess their own poverty. Our time sets before us practically unheard of forms of injustice and exploitation as well as the selfish wrong-doing of individuals or groups. In many, this leads to that \"dimming of hope\" of which I spoke in the Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Ecclesia in Europa (cf. n. 7). In this situation, consecrated persons are called to offer bewildered humanity, weary and lacking in memory, a credible witness of Christian hope, making \"visible the love of God who abandons no one... [and] giving those who have lost their way real reasons for continuing to hope\" (ibid., n. 84). \"We toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God\" (I Tim 4: 10). 3. Before a society in which there is often no room to express love freely, consecrated men and women are called to witness to the logic of the disinterested gift of self: indeed, their choice is expressed \"in a radical gift of self for love of the Lord Jesus and, in him, of every member of the human family\" (Apostolic Exhortation, Vita Consecrata, n. 3). Consecrated life must safeguard a patrimony of life and beauty that can quench every thirst, bind every sore, soothe every wound, fulfilling every desire for joy and love, freedom and peace. 4. \"Passion for Christ, Passion for Humanity\": this was the theme that guided your reflection at the Congress. During it, you clearly expressed your commitment to set out continually from Christ to learn to love your neighbour as he was loved by Christ, who \"came not to be served but serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many\" (Mk 10: 45). The Carmelite mystic, St Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, transported by her love for the divine Bridegroom, called upon the souls of consecrated men and women to love Love, a Love unloved: \"O souls, created of love and for love, why do you not love Love?\"; and she implored Love: \"O Love, who are not loved or known. Love, make all creatures love you, O Love\" (PR 2, 188-189). This love, this burning ardour for Christ and for souls, this unquenchable thirst for divine love and this desire to take it to all men and women must constantly nourish your effort for personal conversion, holiness and evangelization. 5. All of you, consecrated men and women, are called to follow Christ more closely and to have his very sentiments in your hearts (cf. Phil 2: 5), to learn from him, meek and humble of heart (cf. Mt 11: 29), to do the Father's will with him (cf. Jn 6: 38) and to follow him on the way of the Cross. For the disciple, this is the only path. There is no other. Every day, with a joyful and grateful spirit, he or she must set out on the narrow road in the Teacher's footsteps, in order to draw the needed energy from the source from which flows the water of life that never dies. You must open your hearts to the life-giving breath of the Holy Spirit, to compete with one another in fraternal love and service, to open your doors to the weakest, the loneliest and the rejected. In this dawn of the Third Christian Millennium, the witness of your chaste, poor and obedient life will thus become a transparency of the loving face of Christ. 6. You, virgin and chaste for the Kingdom of Heaven, more than anyone else are called to put on Christ, his sentiments of humility, meekness and patience. Your vow of chastity calls to mind the fruitfulness of a nuptial relationship between creatures and their Creator and a space in human hearts that God alone can fill. Called to take part joyfully in the poverty of Christ, who though he was rich yet for our sake became poor to make us rich through his poverty (cf. II Cor 8: 9; Mt 8: 20), witness with your detachment and the aspiration of your whole being to heaven, \"where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal\" (Mt 6: 20). May you always be obedient in Christ. May your Communities be responsible ones in which the tasks of some are not a cause for others to shirk their commitments; Communities in which all exercise their discernment, the charity that builds them and fraternal correction. Show the world that renunciation of your own will and plans in freedom, love and fidelity to the Gospel is a source of happiness and opens life to complete self-fulfilment. 7. When one feels deeply loved, one cannot participate in the mystery of Love, who gives himself, by holding back and watching from afar. You must allow the flames that burn the sacrifice to catch fire in you. And to become love. Openness of heart and mind, even before openness of hand, has always put you consecrated men and women in the front line in the task of responding to the different kinds of poverty that are a feature of contemporary life. You must also be ready today to respond to the challenges that confront all people of good will, individual believers, men and women, the Church and society. Down the centuries, love for your brothers and sisters, especially the most defenceless, young people and children, for those who have lost the meaning of life and feel rejected by everyone, has impelled consecrated persons to give themselves without reserve. Continue to spend yourselves for the world, always conscious that the one measure of love is boundless love. Communicate this special love for the smallest to all those you meet, especially the lay people who are asking to share in your charism and your mission. Always be ready to listen to the new calls of the Spirit, in the effort to identify, together with the Pastors of the particular Churches in which you are called to live, the spiritual and missionary emergencies of the present moment. As I urge you to keep your gaze fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith (cf. Heb 12: 2), I impart a special, affectionate Apostolic Blessing to you and to all consecrated persons across the world.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":2004}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8c520a910b526c92c843"},"text":"To my Venerable Brothers Cardinal Lubomyr Husar Major Archbishop of Lviv for Ukrainians and Cardinal Marian Jaworski Archbishop of Lviv for Latins 1. Apart from being a duty, remembering the drama people have lived through proves especially helpful in awakening in the young generations the commitment in all circumstances to be alert sentinels of respect for the dignity of every human person. And the prayers of suffrage prompted by this remembrance are a balm for believers that soothes their pain, as well as an effective entreaty to the God of the living to give eternal repose to all who were unjustly deprived of the gift of existence. Lastly, dutiful remembrance of the past acquires a value that reaches beyond a Nation's boundaries to other peoples who have been victims of equally dire events and can give solace in common knowledge. These are the sentiments that the 70th anniversary of the consequences of the Holodomor tragedy awakens in my heart: millions of people suffered an atrocious death due to the nefarious success of an ideology that caused suffering and bereavement in many parts of the world throughout the 20th century. It is for this reason, Venerable Brothers, that I want to be present in spirit at the celebrations to commemorate the countless victims of the great famine instigated in Ukraine by the Communist regime. It was an inhuman scheme put into effect in cold blood by those in power at the time. 2. Thinking back over those sad events, I ask you, Venerable Brothers, to convey my solidarity and prayerful thoughts to your Country's Authorities and to your fellow citizens who are especially dear to me. The celebrations, planned to reinforce a proper patriotic love by commemorating the sacrifice of the Country's sons and daughters, are not antagonistic to other nations but are intended to revive in each soul a sense of the dignity of every person, to whatever people he or she may belong. The trenchant words of my Predecessor, Pope Pius XI of venerable memory, spring to mind. Referring to the policies of the Soviet leaders of the time, he made a clear distinction between Government leaders and subjects. While he exonerated the latter, he openly denounced the responsibilities of the system that \"ignores the real origin, nature and true purpose of the State... and denies the rights, dignity and freedom of the human person\" (Encyclical Letter Divini Redemptoris [18 March 1937], II: AAS 29 [1937], n. 77). How can we forget, in this regard, the destruction of so many families, the grief of countless orphans, the confusion of the whole of society? While I feel close to all who suffered the consequences of that tragic drama in 1933, I would like to reassert the need to recall those events, to repeat together once more: \"Never again!\". Awareness of past aberrations is behind the constant incentive to build a more human future, countering every ideology that profanes the life, dignity and just aspirations of the person. 3. Today the experience of the tragedy must guide the feelings and actions of the Ukrainian people towards prospects of concord and cooperation. Unfortunately, the Communist ideology also served to deepen divisions in the social and religious contexts. It is essential to work to bring about sincere and effective peace; in this way it will be possible to pay a proper tribute to the victims who belonged to the entire Ukrainian family. The Christian sentiment of suffrage for those who died as a result of an insane and murderous design must be combined with the desire to build a society in which the common good, natural law, justice for all and the rights of peoples will be constant guides for an effective renewal of the hearts and minds of all who have the honour to belong to the Ukrainian Nation. The memory of past events will thus become a source of inspiration for both present and future generations. 4. During my unforgettable Visit to your Country two years ago, in mentioning the period of mourning that Ukraine lived through 70 years ago I recalled \"the terrible years of the Soviet dictatorship and the dreadful famine of the beginning of the 1930s, when your Country, \"the granary of Europe', was no longer able to feed its own children, who died by the millions\" (Address to Representatives of the Worlds of Politics, Culture, Science, Industry and Business, Presidential Palace, 23 June 2001, n. 3; L'Osservatore Romano English edition, [ORE], 27 June, p. 4). It is to be hoped that with the help of God's grace the lessons of history may enable people to find valid motives for reciprocal understanding, with a view to constructive cooperation in order to build together a Country that can develop harmoniously and peacefully at every level. The achievement of this noble aim depends primarily on the Ukrainians, who are entrusted with the preservation of the Eastern and Western Christian heritage and the responsibility of achieving an original synthesis between culture and civilization. This is the specific contribution that Ukraine is called to make to the construction of that \"common European house\" in which every people will be able to find true acceptance, together with respect for its own identity and values. 5. Venerable Brothers, on this very solemn occasion how can we fail to remember the Gospel seed sown by Sts Cyril and Methodius? How can we not think gratefully of the witness of St Vladimir and of Mother St Olga, through whom God gave your people the grace of Baptism and of new life in Christ? Hearts enlightened by the Gospel understand better how to love the homeland in order to make an effective contribution to its progress on the path of culture and civilization. Family membership must be accompanied by a generous and gratuitous exchange of the gifts inherited as a legacy from previous generations, so as to build a society that is open to the encounter with other peoples and traditions. I hope that the Ukrainian people will be able to look back at the events of history with reconciled hearts, and I entrust all who are still suffering from the consequences of those painful events to the interior consolation of the All Holy Mother of God. I reinforce these sentiments with a special Apostolic Blessing, which I impart to you, Venerable Brothers, and to all who are entrusted to your pastoral care as I invoke upon everyone an abundant outpouring of heavenly favours.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":2003}

The liturgy of this Sunday, a few days after Christmas, invites us to contemplate the Holy Family of Nazareth, a wonderful model of human and supernatural virtues for all Christian families. Let us meditate on the mystery of this unique family: we can find in it values and teachings which today are more indispensable than ever to give human society sound and stable foundations. 2. How I would like the peace, harmony and love of the house in Nazareth to exist in families today! I ask the Lord with insistant prayer to make all Christian parents conscious of their irreplaceable task with regard to their children and to society. A true and effective Gospel witness is expected of them. Every Christian family is called to show \"convincingly that it is possible to live marriage fully in keeping with God's plan and with the true good of the human person - of the spouses, and of the children who are more fragile\" (Novo Millennio ineunte, n. 47). A united family that follows these principles will more easily overcome the trials and difficulties it encounters on its way. In the faithful love of the parents, a gift ceaselessly to foster and safeguard, children can find the best conditions for their growth, helped by Jesus who \"increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favour with God and man\" (Lk 2,52). 3. Today let us entrust to the Holy Family of Nazareth the families of the whole world, especially those that have been most harshly tried by suffering or are in difficulty. In particular, I would like to place the Fourth World Meeting of Families, scheduled to take place in Manila, the Philippines, from 22 to 26 January, under the special protection of the Blessed Virgin, of St Joseph and of the Infant Jesus. The theme chosen - The Christian family: good news for the third millennium - expresses the mission of every Christian family and the Church's confidence in it. May this important event bring the desired spiritual fruits for the Church and for all humanity!","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Angelus","year":2002}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8ce20a910b526c92c845"},"text":"1. Today we shift our gaze from the grotto of Bethlehem where the Saviour was born on Holy Night to the humble house of Nazareth, to contemplate the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, whose feast we celebrate in the festive, family atmosphere of Christmas. The Redeemer of the world chose the family as the place for his birth and growth, thereby sanctifying this fundamental institution of every society. The time he spent in Nazareth, the greater part of his life, continues to be shrouded in deep silence. Very little information about it has been passed on to us by the Evangelists. However, if we aspire to a deeper understanding of Jesus' life and mission, we must draw close to the mystery of the Holy Family of Nazareth to observe and listen. Today's liturgy offers us a providential opportunity to do so. 2. For every believer, and especially for Christian families, the humble dwelling place in Nazareth is an authentic school of the Gospel. Here we admire, put into practice, the divine plan to make the family an intimate community of life and love; here we learn that every Christian family is called to be a small \"domestic church\" that must shine with the Gospel virtues. Recollection and prayer, mutual understanding and respect, personal discipline and community asceticism and a spirit of sacrifice, work and solidarity are typical features that make the family of Nazareth a model for every home. I wanted to highlight these values in the Apostolic Exhortation Familiaris consortio whose 20th anniversary occurred this year. The future of humanity passes through the family which in our time has been more marked than any other institution by the profound and rapid changes in culture and society. However, the Church has never ceased \"to speak and offer her help to those who are already aware of the value of marriage and the family and seek to live it faithfully, to those who are uncertain and anxious and searching for the truth, and to those who are unjustly impeded from living freely their family lives\" (Familiaris consortio, n. 1). She is aware of her responsibility and today too intends to continue \"to offer her services to every person who wonders about the destiny of marriage and the family\" (ibid.). 3. The Church relies especially on the witness and contribution of Christian families to fulfil her urgent mission. Indeed, in the face of the dangers and difficulties that beset the family institution, she invites families to have greater spiritual and apostolic boldness, knowing that the family is called to be \"a sign of unity for the world\" and thus to bear witness to \"the Kingdom and peace of Christ, towards which the whole world is journeying\" (ibid., n. 48). May Jesus, Mary and Joseph bless and protect all the world's families, so that within them may reign the serenity and joy, justice and peace that the newborn Christ has given as a gift to humanity.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Angelus","year":2001}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8d3b0a910b526c92c846"},"text":"1. In the framework of this Holy Year of 2000 it was unthinkable that there should not be a Day of Jubilee for Prisoners. Prison gates cannot exclude from the benefits of this great event those who find themselves spending part of their lives behind them. In remembering these brothers and sisters, I first wish to express the hope that the Risen Lord, who entered the Upper Room through closed doors, will enter all the prisons of the world and find a welcome in the hearts of those within, bringing peace and serenity to everyone. In this Jubilee, the Church celebrates in a special way the mystery of the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. Two thousand years have passed since the Son of God was made man and came to dwell among us. Today as then, the salvation brought by Christ is continually being offered to us, that it may bear abundant fruits of goodness in keeping with the plan of God who wishes to save all his children, especially those who have gone away from him and are looking for the way back. The Good Shepherd is always going in search of the lost sheep, and when he finds them he puts them on his shoulders and brings them back to the flock. Christ is in search of every human being, whatever the situation! 2. This is because Jesus wants to save each one. And with a salvation which is offered, not imposed. What Christ is looking for is trusting acceptance, an attitude which opens the mind to generous decisions aimed at rectifying the evil done and fostering what is good. Sometimes this involves a long journey, but always a stimulating one, for it is a journey not made alone, but in the company of Christ himself and with his support. Jesus is a patient travelling companion, who respects the seasons and rhythms of the human heart. He never tires of encouraging each person along the path to salvation. The experience of the Jubilee is closely linked to the human experience of the passage of time, to which it seeks to give meaning. On the one hand, the Jubilee is intended to help us to remember the past, treasuring the experiences it has brought. On the other hand, the Jubilee opens us to the future, in which human commitment and divine grace must together fashion the time left to us to live. Those in prison look back with regret or remorse to the days when they were free, and they experience their time now as a burden which never seems to pass. In this difficult situation, a strong experience of faith can greatly help in finding the inner balance which every human being needs. This is one reason why the Jubilee is so relevant to prison life: the experience of the Jubilee lived behind bars can open up unexpected human and spiritual vistas. 3. The Jubilee reminds us that time belongs to God. Even time in prison does not escape God's dominion. Public authorities who deprive human beings of their personal freedom as the law requires, bracketing off as it were a longer or shorter part of their life, must realize that they are not masters of the prisoners' time. In the same way, those who are in detention must not live as if their time in prison had been taken from them completely: even time in prison is God's time. As such it needs to be lived to the full; it is a time which needs to be offered to God as a occasion of truth, humility, expiation and even faith. The Jubilee serves to remind us that not only does time belong to God, but that the moments in which we succeed in \"restoring\" all things in Christ become for us \"a time of the Lord's favour\". During the Jubilee, all are called to synchronize the unique and unrepeatable time of their own heart with the time of the merciful heart of God. He is always ready to journey with each one, at their own pace, towards salvation. At times prison life runs the risk of depersonalizing individuals, because it deprives them of so many opportunities for self-expression. But they must remember that before God this is not so. The Jubilee is time for the person, when each one is himself before God, in his image and likeness. And each one is called to move more quickly towards salvation and to advance in the gradual discovery of the truth about himself. 4. The Jubilee is about change. The Old Testament Jubilee year \"was meant to restore equality among all the children of Israel, offering new possibilities to families which had lost their property and even their personal freedom\" (Tertio Millennio Adveniente, 13). The prospect which the Jubilee sets before each one is therefore an opportunity not to be missed. The Holy Year must be used as a chance to right injustices committed, to mitigate excesses, and to recover what might otherwise be lost. And if this is true of every aspect of life, since everything human is capable of improvement, it is especially true of the experience of prison, where life is particularly difficult. But the Jubilee is not just about measures to redress situations of injustice. It also has a positive intention. Just as in ever new ways the mercy of God creates fresh opportunities for growing in goodness, so also to celebrate the Jubilee means to strive to find new paths of redemption in every personal and social situation, even if the situation seems desperate. This is even more obvious with regard to prison life: not to promote the interests of prisoners would be to make imprisonment a mere act of vengeance on the part of society, provoking only hatred in the prisoners themselves. 5. If the Great Jubilee is a chance for those in prison to reflect upon their situation, the same may be said of civil society as a whole, which every day has to come to grips with the reality of crime. It can be said of the authorities who have to maintain public order and promote the common good, and of those in the legal profession, who ought to reflect on the meaning of inflicting punishment and suggest better proposals for society to aim at. These issues have been addressed often enough in history, and substantial progress has been made in conforming the penal system both to the dignity of the human person and to the effective maintenance of public order. But the unease and strains felt in the complex world of the administration of justice and, even more, the suffering attached to prison life show that there is still much to be done. We are still a long way from the time when our conscience can be certain of having done everything possible to prevent crime and to control it effectively so that it no longer does harm and, at the same time, to offer to those who commit crimes a way of redeeming themselves and making a positive return to society. If all those in some way involved in the problem tried to take advantage of the occasion offered by the Jubilee to develop this line of thought, perhaps humanity as a whole could take a great step forward in creating a more serene and peaceful society. Imprisonment as punishment is as old as human history. In many countries, prisons are very overcrowded. Some of them are equipped with good facilities, but living conditions in others are very precarious, not to say altogether unworthy of human beings. What is clear to all is that this kind of punishment generally succeeds only in part in addressing the phenomenon of crime. In fact, in some cases detention seems to create more problems than it solves. This must prompt rethinking with a view to some kind of reform: from this perspective too the Jubilee is an opportunity not to be missed. According to God's plan, all must play their part in helping to build a better society. Obviously, this includes making a great effort in the area of crime prevention. In spite of everything criminal actions are committed. For all to play their part in building the common good they must work, in the measure of their competence, to ensure that prisoners have the means to redeem themselves, both as individuals and in their relations with society. Such a process is based on growth in the sense of responsibility. None of this should be considered utopian. Those who are in a position to do so must strive to incorporate these aims in the legal system. 6. In this regard, therefore, we must hope for a change of attitude, leading to an appropriate adjustment of the juridical system. Clearly this presupposes a strong social consensus and the relative professional skills. A strong appeal of this kind comes from the countless prisons throughout the world, in which millions of our brothers and sisters are held. Above all they call for a review of prison structures, and in some cases a revision of penal law. Regulations contrary to the dignity and fundamental rights of the human person should be definitively abolished from national legislation, as should laws which deny prisoners religious freedom. There will also have to be a review of prison regulations where they give insufficient attention to those who have serious or terminal illnesses. Likewise, institutions offering legal protection to the poor must be further developed. But even in cases where legislation is satisfactory, much suffering comes to prisoners from other sources. I am referring in particular to the wretched state of some of the places of detention where prisoners are forced to live, and the harassment to which they are sometimes subjected because of ethnic, social, economic, sexual, political and religious discrimination. Sometimes prisons can become places of violence resembling the places from which the inmates not infrequently come. Clearly this nullifies any attempt to educate through imprisonment. People in prison also find it difficult to maintain regular contact with their families and loved ones, and structures intended to help those leaving prison in their re-entry into society are often seriously flawed. Appeal to Governments 7. The Great Jubilee of the Year 2000 continues the tradition of the Jubilee Years that have gone before it. On each occasion the celebration of a Holy Year has been an opportunity for the Church and the world to do something in favour of justice, in the light of the Gospel. Jubilees have been an incentive for the community to reconsider human justice against the measure of God's justice. Only a calm appraisal of the functioning of penal institutions, a candid recognition of the goals society has in mind in confronting crime, and a serious assessment of the means adopted to attain these goals have led in the past and can still lead to identifying the corrections which need to be made. It is not a question of an automatic or purely cosmetic application of acts of clemency. This would not affect the essence of things: once the Jubilee is over the situation would return to the way it was. It is a question rather of fostering initiatives which will lay a solid basis for a genuine renewal of both attitudes and institutions. In this sense, those States and Governments which are already engaged in or are planning to undertake a review of their prison system in order to bring it more into line with the requirements of the human person should be encouraged to continue in such an important task. This includes giving more consideration to penalties other than imprisonment. To make prison life more human it is more important than ever to take practical steps to enable prisoners as far as possible to engage in work which keeps them from the degrading effects of idleness. They could be given access to a process of training which would facilitate their re-entry into the workforce when they have served their time. Nor should the psychological assistance which can help resolve personality problems be overlooked. Prison should not be a corrupting experience, a place of idleness and even vice, but instead a place of redemption. To this end, it will certainly help if prisoners are offered the chance to deepen their relationship with God and to become involved in charitable projects and works of solidarity. This will help to speed up their social recovery and to make prisons more livable places. In the context of these proposals, looking to the future and continuing a tradition begun by my Predecessors in Jubilee Years, I turn with confidence to State authorities to ask for a gesture of clemency towards all those in prison: a reduction, even a modest one, of the term of punishment would be for prisoners a clear sign of sensitivity to their condition, and would surely evoke a positive echo in their hearts and encourage them to regret the evil done and lead them to personal repentance. Acceptance of this proposal by the competent authorities would not only encourage prisoners to look to the future with new hope but would also be an eloquent sign, at the dawn of the Third Christian Millennium, of a growing worldwide affirmation of a justice that is more genuine because it is open to the liberating power of love. Upon all those responsible for the administration of justice in society and also upon those who have incurred the sanctions of the law I invoke the Lord's blessings. May God abundantly shed his light upon each of them and grant them the fullness of his heavenly favours. Assuring the men and women who are in prison throughout the world that I am close to them in spirit, I embrace them all as brothers and sisters in the human family.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":2000}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8d7a0a910b526c92c847"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters! 1. Today we are celebrating the Solemnity of All Saints. On this festive occasion the pilgrim Church on earth lifts her gaze to heaven, to the immense throng of men and women to whom God has given a share in his holiness. As the Book of Revelation teaches, they come \"from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues\" (Rv 7: 9). During their earthly life they were committed to always doing his will, to loving him with all their heart and their neighbour as themselves. For this reason they also suffered trials and persecutions, and now enjoy their great and eternal reward in heaven (cf. Mt 5: 11). Dear friends, this is our future! This is the most genuine and universal vocation of all humanity: to form the great family of God's children by striving to anticipate its essential traits here on earth. We are drawn to this goal by the shining example of our many brothers and sisters whom, down the centuries, the Church has recognized as blesseds and saints, offering them as examples and guides to everyone. Today we call upon their common intercession, that every person will open himself to God's love, the source of life and holiness. 2. Tomorrow this supplication will become an intense, unanimous prayer to the Father of mercy for all the faithful departed. In every part of the world the Eucharistic sacrifice will be offered in suffrage for them; it is the pledge of eternal life for the living and the dead, as Christ himself said: ; \"I am the bread of life.... He who eats this bread will live for ever\" (Jn. 6: 48, 58). On these days, those who can will visit cemeteries to pray at the graves of their loved ones. Today I too will go down to the Vatican Grottoes to pray at the tombs of my Predecessors. I will also go in spirit to the cemetery in Kraków, where my own deceased loved ones are buried, and to the other cemeteries of the world in order to pray especially at the forgotten graves. The liturgy, in fact, teaches us to pray for everyone, in the name of that bond of solidarity that joins the Church's members to one another: it is a bond stronger than death itself. May no one lack the support of our prayer. 3. In this spiritual climate, we feel Holy Mary's living, consoling presence closer to us than ever. Today we call upon her as the Queen of All Saints, as we contemplate her at the centre of the heavenly assembly of the blessed spirits. Tomorrow we will entrust the souls of the faithful departed to her, the Mother of Mercy. For the People of God she is a sign of consolation and sure hope. We see in her the living icon of Christ's words: \"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God\" (Mt 5: 8). Through her intercession may we make our own this Gospel beatitude. After praying the Angelus, the Holy Father appealed for peace in Chechnya. On today's solemnity I would also like to ask you to implore from the Lord, through the intercession of all the saints, the precious gift of peace for Chechnya, a land very dear to us. May our heartfelt prayer obtain the grace of harmony for those sorely-tried communities, as we express the hope that the tensions there will be peacefully resolved with respect for the rights of all citizens.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Angelus","year":1999}

Let us now turn our gaze to Mary most holy, whom our brothers and sister tenderly loved and faithfully imitated. Devotion to the Virgin Mother of God and the recitation of the Rosary held a special place in their lives. The month of October is the month of Mary, the month of the Rosary. This simple, profound prayer, dear to individuals and to families, was once widely recited by the Christian people. How good it would be if the Rosary were rediscovered and appreciated today, especially in families! It helps us reflect on the life of Christ and the mysteries of salvation; by repeated invocation of the Blessed Virgin, it dispels the seeds of family disintegration; it is a sure bond of communion and peace. I urge everyone, especially Christian families, to find in the Holy Rosary a daily strength and support for walking the path of fidelity. May Mary, Queen of the Holy Rosary and of All Saints, help us to pursue our mission as believers without wavering. Let us turn to her with filial abandonment, as did the new blesseds whom we contemplate today in heavenly glory. May Our Lady especially support families, so that they can accept the Gospel with integrity and live it in their daily lives. I greet the French-speaking pilgrims present at the beatification, particularly those from Brittany, the native region of Mother Theodore Guérin. I invite them to keep alive the missionary spirit that motivated the new blessed. I grant my Apostolic Blessing to everyone. I greet the English-speaking pilgrims present here in St Peter’s Square to honour the four new beati, and I welcome in particular the visitors from the United States accompanying the Sisters of Providence. May the example of these faithful witnesses to Christ inspire us all to ever greater fidelity. God bless you all! I affectionately greet the Spanish and Latin American Bishops and faithful present here, as well as the Daughters of the Divine Shepherdess and the members of the great Calasanctian family. The beatification of Fr Faustino Míguez today gladdens the way of the Church, our Mother and Teacher. As a model Christian educator, he gives a fresh impulse to the Gospel commitment of Catholic colleges on the threshold of the third millennium. My affectionate greeting also goes to the Brazilians who have come for the beatification of Friar Galvão. May this festive day remind you that the Pope is with you in his prayers and asks God, through the intercession of Our Lady of the Apparition, for peace and harmony for every Brazilian family.

{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8dcd0a910b526c92c849"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, 1. Yesterday we celebrated the Solemnity of All Saints and today the liturgy invites us to commemorate the faithful departed. The Church links her contemplation of those who have already attained God’s glory with her remembrance of those who have gone before us marked with the sign of faith and who now sleep in peace (cf. Roman Canon). I spiritually join all who in these days are visiting the graves of their departed ones in the cemeteries of Rome and the whole world. I go on spiritual pilgrimage especially to where the victims of violence and war, of injustice and hunger are buried. May Jesus, who said: \"I am the resurrection and the life\" (Jn 11:25), grant to all the departed the rest of the just and the fullness of eternal life. 2. The Church’s tradition has always recommended prayers for the dead. The basis for this prayer of suffrage is found in the communion of the Mystical Body. As the Second Vatican Council stresses: \"In full consciousness of this communion of the whole Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, the Church in her pilgrim members, from the very earliest days of the Christian religion, has honoured with great respect the memory of the dead\" (Lumen gentium, n. 50). Therefore she encourages cemetery visits, the care of graves and prayers of suffrage as a witness of confident hope, amid the sorrow of being separated from one’s loved ones. Death is not the last word on human fate, because man is destined for endless life, which finds its fulfilment in God. For this reason, the Council emphasizes: \"Faith, with its solidly based teaching, provides every thoughtful man with an answer to his anxious queries about his future lot. At the same time it makes him able to be united in Christ with his loved ones who have already died, and gives hope that they have found true life in God\" (Gaudium et spes, n. 18). 3. With this belief in man’s ultimate destiny, we now turn to Mary, who experienced the drama of Christ’s death at the foot of the Cross and then shared in the joy of his Resurrection. May she, the Gate of Heaven, help us more and more to understand the value of praying for our departed loved ones. May she sustain us each day on our earthly pilgrimage and help us never to lose sight of the ultimate goal of life, which is paradise.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Angelus","year":1997}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8df00a910b526c92c84a"},"text":"Dear Brothers and Sisters, 1. Today, the Fourth Sunday of Advent, the liturgy prepares us for Christmas, already very near, inviting us to meditate on the Gospel of the Annunciation. It is the well-known scene, also portrayed by famous artists, in which the Angel Gabriel discloses the divine plan of the Incarnation to Mary: “And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus” (Lk 1:31; cf. Mt 1:21, 25). Jesus! This name, by which Christ was known in his family and among his friends in Nazareth, exalted by the crowds and invoked by the sick during the years of his public ministry, calls to mind his identity and mission as Saviour. In fact “Jesus” means “God saves”. A blessed name, which also proved to be a sign of contradiction, ending by being written on the Cross in justification of his death sentence (cf. Jn 19:19). But this name, in the supreme sacrifice of Golgotha, shone forth as a life-giving name in which God offers the grace of reconciliation and peace to all mankind. 2. In this name the Church finds her whole good, she invokes it unceasingly, she proclaims it with ever new ardour. As the Catechism of the Catholic Church says: “The name ‘Jesus’ signifies that the very name of God is present in the person of his Son, made man for the universal and definitive redemption from sins” (432). It is the divine name which alone brings salvation “for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). Jesus himself shows us the saving power of his name, giving us this consoling certitude: “If you ask anything of the Father, he will give it to you in my name” (Jn 16:23). Thus whoever calls with faith on the name of Jesus can have an experience similar to the one mentioned by the Evangelist Luke when he remarks that the crowd sought to touch him, “for power came forth from him and healed them all” (Lk 6:19). Let us learn lovingly to repeat the Holy Name of Jesus, especially during this first year of the triennium of preparation for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000! 1997, as is generally known, is dedicated to reflection on Christ and, repeating the name of Jesus with adoring love, putting it at the centre of our prayer, especially liturgical, we will make our own the Apostle Paul’s instruction: “and at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth” (Phil 2:10). 3. With what motherly tenderness must the Blessed Virgin, whom we contemplate awaiting her Son’s birth, have pronounced Jesus’ name! In the prayer that the Church addresses to her with the Hail Mary, she is associated with the very blessing of her Son: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus”. Let Mary put on our lips and impress on our hearts this most holy Name from which comes our salvation. ","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Angelus","year":1996}

{"_id":{"$oid":"610d8e8c0a910b526c92c84c"},"text":"1. Monte Cassino... What does this word say to all of you, present here today in this cemetery? It says a great deal: it speaks of the victory won there; it also speaks of the price Poles paid for it, fighting as the allies of other nations. This alliance was the consequence of events that began on September 1939. The Polish Republic was then seeking allies in the West, aware that it would be unable to face the invasion of Hitler's Germany alone. But perhaps this was not the only reason. Poles were aware of the fact that the conflict they were forced to face was not only demanded by patriotism, to defend the independence of the State they had so recently regained, but also had broader implications for the whole of Europe. Europe had to defend itself from the same threat as Poland. The national socialist system was opposed - if this can be said - to the \"European spirit\". And this problem could not be dealt with by endless attempts at apparent solutions. These attempts resulted in further victims with the invasion of Czechoslovakia. It was clear that other similar consequences would have occurred had Europe not decided to take a firm stand in the military sense as well. The decision taken by the Polish Republic in 1939 was therefore right. Indeed, it clearly appeared that Europe could not be defended without deciding on a defensive war, whose first phase was precisely Poland in 1939. Poles fought for their country's independence 2. The victory of Monte Cassino took place five years later on 18 May 1944. The end of the terrible World War was now not far off. Not only had it raged through almost all of Europe, but it had also drawn non-European States into its vortex, the United States first, into the ranks of the Allies, and then Japan, into those of the so-called Axis. To understand what happened in Monte Cassino, it is necessary again to reflect on another date of the past: 17 September 1939, when Poland, desperately defending herself against invasion from the West, was attacked from the East. And this jeopardized the course of events in that Polish September, leading to a double occupation, with Hitler's concentration camps in the West and those of the Soviets in the East. The tragedy of Katyn, still today a unique testimony of the struggle undertaken at the time, took place in the East. In order to understand the events that occurred at Monte Cassino, we also need to have this Eastern chapter of our history before our eyes, because the army commanded by General Wladyslaw Anders, which played such an important role in the battle of Monte Cassino, consisted largely of Poles deported to the Soviet Union. In addition, there were soldiers and officers who, from occupied Poland, had secretly reached the West through Hungary, with the intention of continuing the fight there for the independence of their homeland. Monte Cassino was an important milestone in this struggle. The soldiers involved in that battle were convinced that by helping to solve the problems concerning the whole of Europe, they were on the way to an independent Poland. 3. Those of you who fought here treasure in your hearts the memory of all your fellow soldiers. You have come here to visit the Polish military cemetery at Monte Cassino, where General Wladyslaw Anders and Archbishop Józef Gawlina, the faithful chaplain to the Polish army on the battlefield, also repose. Many of your companions rest here: soldiers and officers with names that are not only Polish but also Ukrainian, Belarusian and Jewish. They all fought in the battle for the same great cause, as the cemeteries attest: those of Monte Cassino, Loreto, Bologna and Casamassima. Our thoughts and prayers are addressed to those who fell, who, departing life, were thinking of their loved ones in Poland. Their death was a witness to the readiness that marked all society at the time: to give one's life for the holy cause of one's homeland. We cannot forget that a few months later, in that same year of 1944, the Warsaw Uprising took place, an episode which corresponded to the battle of Monte Cassino. The Poles in their homeland felt that they had to fight this battle, in order to stress the fact that Poland had been fighting from the first day to the last, not only to defend her own freedom, but for the future of Europe and the world. They were convinced that the Soviet army, already close to Warsaw, together with the Polish battalions from the territory of the Soviet Union, would contribute decisively to the success of the Warsaw Uprising. But unfortunately this was not the case. We know that Poland paid very dearly for the Warsaw Uprising: not only with the death of so many thousands of Polish men and women of my contemporaries' generation, but even with the almost total destruction of the capital. New life has risen from the ruins 4. While we have the image of 50 years ago before our eyes, we must once more repeat the word Monte Cassino, a name that has a far older meaning than the one attributed to it in 1944. We must go back 15 centuries to the time of St Benedict. Precisely at Monte Cassino one of those Benedictine abbeys that was to initiate the formation of Europe arose. Historians show that on the basis of the Benedictine principle \"ora et labora\", after the decline of the Roman Empire of the West and after the migrations of peoples, this Europe began to emerge, whose civil and cultural foundations have been preserved to this day. This is Christian Europe. It was St Benedict in the West, like Saints Cyril and Methodius in the East, who contributed to the Christianization of Europe in the first millennium. Moreover, the European nations are indebted to them for the very beginnings of their own culture and of this Western civilization, which has continued to develop over the centuries and has also spread to other continents. From this standpoint, what does the battle of Monte Cassino represent? It was the clashing of two \"projects\": one, both in the East and in the West, aiming at uprooting Europe from its Christian past linked to her Patrons, and in particular to St Benedict, and the other, striving to defend the Christian tradition of Europe and the \"European spirit\". The fact that the Abbey of Monte Cassino was destroyed has a symbolic value. Christ said: \"Unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains just a grain of wheat; but if it dies, it produces much fruit\" (Jn 12:24). Evidently, the ancient Abbey of Monte Cassino had to be destroyed so that a new life for all of Europe could rise from its ruins. And in a certain sense, this is what happened. On the ruins of the Second World War, a united Europe began to be built, and those who were its first builders staunchly clung to the Christian roots of European culture. 5. We Poles were unable to participate directly in the rebuilding of Christian Europe undertaken in the West. We were left with the ruins of our capital. Although we had been allies in the victorious coalition, we found ourselves in the situation of the defeated, upon whom the domination of the East, within the Soviet Bloc, was imposed for more than 40 years. Hence for us the struggle did not end in 1945; we were forced to take it up all over again. Furthermore, the same thing happened for our neighbours. Commemorating the Monte Cassino victory, it is therefore essential today to add the truth about all Polish men and women, who in an apparently independent State, became the victims of a totalitarian system. In their homeland, they gave their lives for the very cause for which Poles had died in 1939, then throughout the occupation and finally at Monte Cassino and in the Warsaw Uprising. We must also remember how many were killed at the hand of the Polish institutions and security services that served the system imposed by the East. They must al least be remembered before God and before history, in order not to veil the truth about our past at this decisive moment in history. The Church commemorates her martyrs in martyrologies. We cannot allow that in Poland, especially Poland today, the martyrology of the Polish nation should not be recomposed. We pray for a good use of freedom 6. This is the price we paid for our current independence. If after the First World War it was necessary to fight to put Poland back on the map of Europe, after the Second World War no one could harbour any doubts on this score. The Polish nation had paid such a high price, had claimed its right to exist as a State with such tremendous efforts and suffering, that even our enemies - let us say, the dubious \"friends\" of the East and the West - could not question this right. This too must be said today, on the occasion of the great anniversary of the battle of Monte Cassino, because it has fundamental significance for our Polish and European present. If it is impossible to detach the \"today\" from the past, from all our history and especially from the past 50 years, it is impossible to forget that every human \"today\" is the introduction to a human future. What will the future of Poland and Europe be like? There are many promising elements for this future. Apparently Europe has detached herself from the dangerous systems that have prevailed in the 20th century, and the desire for peaceful co-existence among nations is rather general. Is this also the desire to build our own future in the spirit of Monte Cassino? Monte Cassino represents a symbol proven by the experience of history. But should we not fear that we might be unable to draw the right conclusions from this experience, letting ourselves be misled by other \"spirits\" that have little in common with Monte Cassino, or are even opposed to it, perhaps to the point of being responsible for its systematic destruction? Thus we cannot conclude our meditation on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the victory of Monte Cassino without adding a similar warning for the future and together beseeching God to remain with us and we with him. We must pray that we may be able to make good use of the freedom purchased at such a high price: because we are returning to the heritage of St Benedict and of Sts Cyril and Methodius, co-patrons of Europe in the West and in the East. At the end of the second millennium and on the eve of the third, I recommend all those present and the whole of our country to them, as well as to all the patrons of our nation, especially to the one who is the symbol of our century, the martyr saint of Auschwitz, Maximilian Maria Kolbe, as well as to Our Lady of Jasna Góra, Queen of Poland. May almighty God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, bless you.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":1994}

It is with profound grief that we call to mind what happened then, and indeed all that happened in the long black night of the Shoah. We remember, and we need to remember, but we need to remember with renewed trust in God and in his all–healing blessing. In their Pastoral Letter of 30 November 1990, the Polish Bishops wrote about what took place in Poland then, but also about the present–day responsibility of Christians and Jews: \"the mutual loss of life, a sea of terrible suffering and of wrongs endured should not divide but unite us. The places of execution, and in many cases, the common graves, call for this unity\". As Christians and Jews, following the example of the faith of Abraham, we are called to be a blessing for the world (Cf. Gen 12: 2ss.). This is the common task awaiting us. It is therefore necessary for us, Christians and Jews, to be first a blessing to one another. This will effectively occur if we are united in the face of the evils which are still threatening: indifference and prejudice, as well as displays of anti–Semitism. For what has already been achieved by Catholics and Jews through dialogue and cooperation I give thanks with you to God; for what we are still called to do I offer my ardent prayers. May God further guide us along the paths of his sovereign and loving will for the human family.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":1993}

Today, the Successor of Peter has come to Tabora to rejoice with you in the communion that is ours in the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. As your brother in Christ, I have long looked forward to being with you. And now, I already feel at home among you! On this happy occasion, it is my pastoral duty to confirm you in the faith you have received, and to encourage you in the work of spreading the Good News of salvation in Jesus Christ our Lord. Ninawasalimu nyote kwa ushirika wetu katika Roho Mtakatifu. Kwanza kabisa ninamsalimu kwa moyo wote Askofu Mkuu Mario Mgulunde, na ninamshukuru kwa maneno yake ya kunitambulisha. Ninawasalimu pia Askofu Mkuu Marko Mihayo, Maaskofu wote, mapadre, watawa na walei wote wa Jumbo Kuu la Tabora na wa majimbo ya Kahama, Kigoma, Singida na Sumbawanga. Kwa upendo mwingi ninawasalimu vijana wote wanaojitayarishia daraja ya Upadre katika Seminari Kuu ya Mtakatifu Paulo, Kipalapala. Na kwa heshima na moyo wa shukrani ninawasalimu viongozi mbalimbali wa Serikali na wa kidini kwa kuwepo kwao hapa. (In the fellowship of the Spirit, I greet you all. In the first place, I cordially greet Archbishop Mario Mgulunde, whom I thank for his kind words of welcome, Archbishop Mark Mihayo and all the Bishops, priests, religious and laity of the Archdiocese of Tabora and the Dioceses of Kahama, Kigoma, Singida and Sumbawanga. With particular affection I greet the young men who are studying for the priesthood at Saint Paul’s Seminary in Kipalapala. And with gratitude and esteem I greet the civil authorities and religious leaders who honour us with their presence this afternoon). 2. Saint Paul told the members of the Church in Corinth that the many charisms or spiritual gifts which they had received were the fruit of the Holy Spirit, \"who distributes different gifts to different people just as He chooses\" (1 Cor. 12, 11). Like the landowner in the Gospel parable (Cfr. Matth. 20, 1-16), God apportions His grace as part of His mysterious plan for the salvation of the world in Jesus, His Son (Cfr. Eph. 1, 9-10). All our gifts and talents are given to us in trust, and must be used to encourage our brothers and sisters on the path of faith, hope and love. To each person the gifts of the Spirit are given for the common good (Cfr. 1 Cor. 12, 7). On the one hand, the People of God are endowed with an abundance of charisms and gifts, leading to holiness of life and the witness of good works. On the other hand, in the Church there is also a rich variety of ministries, offices and roles of service which all combine to build up Christ’s kingdom of grace and peace. Each person has his or her calling and place in the Body of Christ. No one is excluded from working in the Lord’s vineyard! 3. The ordained ministry of deacons, priests and bishops is of course the essential channel through which Christ continues to teach, sanctify and guide his followers in the way of the Gospel. The witness of men and women religious shows forth the love and meekness of Christ, His complete consecration to the Father’s will and His interior freedom in the service of others’ spiritual and material needs. Your local Churches have need of good and holy priests and religious! There are many of them here today. We must pray unceasingly for vocations, so that many young men and women will respond generously to the Lord’s call. Walei wote, waume kwa wake, wanao wajibu wa kubadili mazingira wanamoishi, wakifanya imani yao kuwa nyenzo ya maisha ya kila siku, na ni kwa nija hiyo, familia, jamii na mataifa yote vitaendelea vikifuata mafundisho yaliyotajwa kwenye Injili kuhusu Heri. (But it is lay men and women who must play a direct role in transforming the world in which they live, bringing their faith to bear on the realities of everyday life so that families, societies and entire nations will advance in the spirit of the Beatitudes). The fathers and mothers of families, men and women in the home, in the fields, the mines or the factories, in every form of work and social life are called to exercise their \"royal priesthood\" (1 Petr. 2, 9), offering their whole lives to God as a \"holy sacrifice\" (Rom. 12, 1), showing forth God’s goodness in the world and reconciling all created things to the Father through Christ (Cfr. Col. 1, 20). Mfano tuliousikia katika Injili ya leo unahusu waumini wote: mtu asikae tu bila kazi. Kila mmoja ashiriki kazi ya ujenzi wa Kanisa na wa jamii kufuatana na neema aliyoipokea. Bwana asema kwa kila mmoja wetu\"Nenda nawe katika shamba la mizabibu\". (The parable of today’s Gospel Reading applies to all the faithful: no one can stand idly by. Each one according to the grace received has much to do in building up the Church and society. To each one the Lord says: \"You go into the vineyard too\") (Matth. 20, 7). 4. Dear brothers and sisters: How many and varied are the gifts with which the Spirit has built up the Church in Tanzania! Through the wise and dedicated efforts of the missionaries, the Gospel was first preached among you. Through the patient labours and heroic sacrifices of countless priests, religious Sisters and Brothers, catechists, teachers, and Christian parents, the Church has been implanted in your nation. Seeing all of you here today I am filled with hope and confidence that the Holy Spirit will continue to raise up men and women who will selflessly devote themselves to the flowering of authentic holiness, and the generous service of their brothers and sisters! What still needs to be done? Where is the Lord leading the Church in Tanzania after over a hundred years of evangelization and at the approach of a new Christian millennium? The Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops, now in preparation, is a \"sign\" that this is a special hour of grace for the Church on this Continent (Cfr. Lineamenta, 13). In coming to your country, one of my principal intentions is to appeal to you to meet the challenges of this new stage of evangelization with all your \"gifts\" and with all the resources of your local Churches. Neither the specific event of the Synod nor the general task of evangelization are matters for Bishops and priests only. The part to be played by the laity is of essential importance, for it is a question of winning Africa to truths and values which, in order to be believed and accepted, must be experienced in the concrete daily existence of the Christian community. When the world sees your spirit of prayer and adoration of God, your solidarity with others, especially the poorest and neediest, your courage in times of suffering and difficulties, your self-control in the face of violence and injury, and your temperance in all things, then the world will ask: Why are they so? Who inspires Tanzania’s Christians to such great love? At that point, the well-known words of Christ will echo in all their truth: \"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill-top cannot be hidden\" (Matth 5, 14). 5. There are countless ways in which lay men and women can announce the word of God and make known the \"infinite treasure of Christ\" (Eph. 3, 8). In particular, I wish to encourage the mothers and fathers of families to continue to lead their children in prayer and to teach them the love of God and the rules of Christian living. A special form of announcement is the work of catechesis in parishes, schools and youth movements: Ninawashukuru Makatekista waliopo hapa na wengine wote popote Tanzania kwa mfano bora na moyo wao wa kujitoa. (I thank all the catechists present here and throughout Tanzania for their exemplary commitment). Never abandon your dedication to preaching the full truth of Christ crucified, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power (Cfr. 1 Cor. 1, 17). In spreading God’s word, however, both proclamation and catechesis must also be accompanied by a correct spirit of dialogue in truth and love with all those who do not share our Catholic faith so that harmony and faith will grow. Religious and moral convictions cannot be imposed; they must attract acceptance by their own intrinsic beauty and power to persuade. The truth which the Gospel of Jesus Christ reveals is no \"worldly wisdom\" (Cfr. ibid. 1, 20), but the reality of the Father’s infinite and merciful love made known in Jesus’ compassion for the multitudes (Cfr. Matth. 9, 36), and in the Christian community’s unfailing care for the least of Christ’s brothers and sisters (Cfr. ibid. 25, 40). Now as always, practical solidarity with our neighbour is the most compelling and immediate demand of Christian love, and a most effective way of communicating the Gospel message. In the increasing complexity of modern societies, the work of human development and the promotion of greater justice and of the structural changes that will permit peoples and nations to provide for the good of all their members is another valid and necessary form of commitment on the part of Christians. What is called the \"love of preference for the poor\", as long as it excludes no one, manifests the Church’s adamant defence of the human dignity that is every individual’s inalienable right. Ndugu zangu walei wa Tanzania, wake kwa waume, mnaitwa kuchukua jukumu zaidi, mkiongozwa na wachungaji wenu, katika utume wa Kanisa nchini mwenu na katika bara la Afrika. Msiuache \"wakati huu wa neema\" upite hivi hivi. \"Sasa ndio wakati wa mavuno\". (You, the Catholic lay men and women of Tanzania, are being called to become increasingly responsible, alongside your pastors, for the Church’s mission in your country and in Africa. Do not let this \"hour of grace\" slip by. The harvest is ready! (Cfr. Marc. 4, 29). 6. Nikiwa hapa Tabora, ninapenda kusema kwamba Kanisa linawashughulikia kwa namna ya pekee wale ambao ni wazee au wagonjwa hasa vipofu na viziwi. Baadhi yao wapo katika ibada hii. (Here in Tabora, I wish to refer to the Church’s particular concern for those members of the community who are elderly or sick, especially the blind and the deaf, some of whom are present at this celebration). Dear friends: you too have a very important and noble mission within the Body of Christ, the Church! Through your union with the Lord in the mystery of his suffering, you are challenged to grow in holiness, to know more profoundly and to share more generously with others the gift of God’s love as it has been revealed in the sufferings of His Son. Through the spiritual solidarity which unites us in the \"communion of saints\", your sufferings are helping to bring about the spread of God’s Kingdom and the triumph of His grace. Ndugu wapendwa, jueni kwamba, kuwepo kwangu hapa pamoja nanyi ni ishara ya upendo katika Kristu, ambaye ndiye Mkuu wa Kanisa. (Be assured that the Pope’s presence with you today is a clear sign of the Church’s love for you in Christ, her Head). I wish also to acknowledge with gratitude the devoted service given to our suffering and handicapped brothers and sisters by the Archdiocese of Tabora, the Missionaries of Charity, and by our brothers and sisters of the Pentecostal Church. Here too, I gladly express the Church’s appreciation of the efforts of those who serve the needy and those who strive through their involvement in the political life of your country to bear witness to Christ and to ensure a better and more secure life for all Tanzania’s people. 7. Dear brothers and sisters: in the Gospel of today’s Liturgy, the generous landowner goes out at various times into the market place to find workers to send into his vineyard. Some were present to answer his call at daybreak; others appeared later in the morning, and some were not sent until the day was nearly done. Does this parable not remind us that it is never too late to serve the Lord and to benefit from His infinite generosity? The Church today has great need of young people, filled with life and enthusiasm, to show to others the hope and joy which come from embracing Christ and His way of holiness. She has need of mature Christians, who have grown in wisdom and prudence as they have learned to let their faith in Christ permeate every aspect of their thinking and behaviour. The Church needs holy and committed believers of every age, who are nourished by prayer, solid in faith and zealous in proclaiming to the world the salvation, joy and peace which come from the Risen Lord! As you strive to use the many gifts which you have received in Baptism for the building up of the Church in Tanzania, I commend you to the prayers of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Through her obedience to the word of God and her openness to the Spirit, she became the Mother of God and Mother of the Church. I pray that she will guide all of you in the ways of holiness and assist you in your efforts to live fully the great calling which you have received in Christ! Mungu awabariki nyote! Amina. (May God bless you all! Amen).","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Homilie","year":1990}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d904b0a910b526c92c851"},"text":"1. These words of the Gospel take us back to the Upper Room where Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples. They take us back to the origin of the Eucharist, which Jesus instituted as the Sacrifice of reconciliation and the Sacrament of unity for all. Today, here in your capital city, these words remind us of the beginnings of the Gospel and of the Church on Korean soil. In 1984 I came to your country to join you in giving thanks to Almighty God for that “beginning”. which took place two hundred years ago. On that occasion I solemnly canonized your Korean Martyrs. Andrew Kim and his companions bore witness to Christ and suffered death for their faithfulness. They are the ones to whom Christ made known the Father’s name. They are the ones the Father gave him out of the world. They became the “beginning” for so many others who have believed in Christ “through their word”, that is, through the witness of their lives (Cfr. Io 17, 20). You Catholic young people of Korea know what it means to follow their example. It means to make Jesus Christ the central force of your lives and to fulfil the work that he gives you to do in the building of his kingdom! 2. The Pope is happy to meet the youth representatives of each parish in the land, of each Catholic group, association and movement. I greet each one of you! I welcome the presence of the students, the workers, the farmers; and I express my heartfelt union with those of you and all Korean youth who are burdened with suffering or illness. I gladly welcome the young men and women of other Christian communities and of other religious traditions. Seoul has been chosen as the venue of the Forty-fourth International Eucharistic Congress. In these days, in a special way in Korea, the Church perpetuates Christ’s prayer for all those the Father has given him out of the world. At the Last Supper did he himself not say: “I am praying... for those you have given me, for they are yours” (Ibid. 17, 9)? This prayer is for all the sons and daughters of this land and this nation. This prayer is for the peoples represented here by those who have come from the other countries of Asia and from Oceania, Africa, Europe and America. Jesus’ prayer is for the whole world without distinction of nationalities, without discrimination of race or ethnic origin. What is his prayer? Christ says to the Father: “In your name keep those you have given me, so that they may be one as we are one” (Ibid. 17, 11). The unity of Christ’s disciples, in faith and love, is the great sign that the world needs in order to believe. 3. In the Upper Room where the Eucharist was instituted Christ also prayed the following words: “As you have sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world: I consecrate myself for their sake now, that they may be consecrated in the truth” (Io. 17- 18-19). Young friends! Accept these words of our Master and Redeemer as words spoken about you and to you! Accept the Sacrifice through which Christ consecrates himself as an offering for you – for all, and therefore for you! Accept the mission which flows from your Christian vocation. In fact, through Baptism, Confirmation and the Eucharist you bear within yourselves the heritage of Christ’s Sacrifice, of his Death and Resurrection. By virtue of this Sacrifice you can and should share in Christ’s saving mission: making his peace and reconciliation effective in your lives and in the world around you! Christ’s mission, as revealed in the Gospel and signified in the Eucharist, is always and everywhere a work of unity and peace. Your presence today in this stadium, with the Pope, in the company of your bishops and priests, must become a sign of your willingness to take up this task! Can the Church in Korea count on its young people? On the holiness of life, and on the intelligent and generous collaboration of each one of you? The Pope hopes and prays that it may be so! 4. The Liturgy recalls the Old Testament figure of Joseph, the son of the Patriarch Jacob, who was betrayed by his own brothers and sold to a group of travelling merchants. In this way they wished to banish him from their home, because he seemed to be above them. The reality of disunity, of rancour and hatred, of envy and violence is all too frequent in human experience, even among members of the same family, of the same nation, and between the nations of the world. You yourselves are witnesses of the painful divisions that affect your own people. You are searching for a solution. But which of the many paths proposed is the right one? Where are true unity and true peace to be found? The experience of Joseph can enlighten us. When he finally reveals himself to his brothers – as the one whom they had sold away into slavery – they feared a just punishment for the harm which they had inflicted upon him. But, Joseph said to them: “Fear not... you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good” (Gen. 50, 19-20). Here we discover an extraordinarily profound and striking dimension of human relationships: the possibility of reconciliation and pardon, the excellence of justice grounded in love and expressed in an encounter of genuine openness and brotherhood. Here we begin to see that true unity and peace are not merely questions of economic and political structures. They are, more basically, the result of human acts of sincere love and effective solidarity among individuals and peoples. 5. The Old Testament figure of Joseph has always been seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ. Jesus too was betrayed. He was given up to death on the Cross. All share in that death because the Son of God accepted the Sacrifice of the Cross as an offering for the sins of the world. Jesus’ ignominious death on Golgotha became the source of redemption for all mankind. By means of his Sacrifice, Christ opened the way for us to leave behind the slavery of sin and to find the path of salvation and of new life in God. That is the meaning of Jesus’ prayer the night before he died: “For their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be consecrated in the truth” (Io. 17, 19). Christ is our way, our truth and our life in overcoming the powers of division, disharmony and death in the world. For you, young Christians, there should be no doubt: Jesus Christ makes true peace by the blood of the Cross (Cfr. Col. 1, 20). It is precisely on the Cross that he shows clearly that love is stronger than hatred and violence, forgiveness is more just than retribution. This is not weakness, or mere passivism. Your martyrs, many of them of your own age, were much stronger in their suffering and death than their persecutors in their hatred and violence. Violence destroys; love transforms and builds up. This is the challenge which Christ offers to you, young people of Korea, who wish to be instruments of true progress in the history of your country. Christ calls you, not to tear down and destroy, but to transform and build up! 6. I wish to say a special word of encouragement and welcome to the twelve young men and women who will receive the Sacrament of Baptism during the Mass. They symbolize all those to whom Jesus has made known the Father’s name. They remind us that we have all been given a share in the “fullness” that “dwelt” in Christ and through him is given to us as we make our earthly pilgrimage to union with the Father. Dear young people of Korea: “new life” in Christ – this is what you can contribute to your fellow young people and to Korea. Christ is the source of a new style of life. That new life starts with an inner change of heart and leads to solidarity and service. It is made of courage in trials and difficulties, of perseverance in doing good, of self-control even in the face of harm and injustice received, and of wise and intelligent cooperation in the social and cultural development of the community in which you live. You are witnesses of the sufferings of your people. Some of you perhaps have suffered personally for the sake of justice. As Catholic young people you must know that the rebirth to which you aspire cannot come from hatred and violence. It must come from the transforming power of the love which Jesus pours into your hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to you in Baptism and which is constantly nourished in the Eucharist (Cfr. Rom. 5, 5). The Eucharist is both grace and mission, both gift of life and call to discipleship. 7. Jesus, “making peace by the blood of his Cross” (Col. 1, 20) reconciled us to the Father and to one another. The new life, the true life you all yearn for with youthful fervour, was born of the loving self-giving of Jesus on the Cross. It is this mystery of new life that we are celebrating tonight in the Eucharist. To this true life you are called to bear witness – like Andrew Kim and his companion martyrs – through your own forgiveness, through your own selfless sharing and service, through your own self-giving. Here in Seoul, on this occasion, the Successor of Peter begs you, in the name of Christ, “to remain stable and steadfast in the faith, not shifting from the hope of the Gospel you have heard” (Col. 1, 23). My dear young people, be courageous witnesses before all the world of Jesus’ reconciliation and unity, be the joyful and brave instruments of his peace! Serang-hanun cholmuni yorobun, yorobunun uri modu'e himang-imnida. Amen.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Homilie","year":1989}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d90a70a910b526c92c852"},"text":"To the Distinguished Representatives at the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking The phenomenon of drug abuse is one of the greatest tragedies plaguing society today, a tragedy of ever-widening proportions that strikes both industrialized and developing countries with devastating effects on individuals, families and the whole social fabric. The fact that the abusers are predominantly young people poses a particular threat to the future stability of society as we advance towards the end of the Second Millennium. Unfortunately there are indications that this human tragedy is steadily worsening: a) illegal drugs are being produced in ever-increasing quantities; b) illicit drug trafficking which produces immense profits continues unchecked; c) the vastly widespread character of drug abuse which, although concentrated mostly among young people, is also found at every level of modern society, in rural as well as urban areas, among both men and women, among all races and cultures. There is no country which is now immune from this modern scourge, either in the East of the West, in the northern or southern hemispheres, in the poorer or the richer countries. Many factors contribute to the dramatic increase in drug abuse. Surely a primary one is the breakdown of the family. In addition, there is a steady weakening of traditional ways of life which for generations have passed on cultural values and given meaning to daily existence; there are increasing tensions in human relationships, rising unemployment, sub-human standards of living, fears engendered by the threat of nuclear war and numerous other social factors, not the least of which is a psychological need to escape from the hardships and painful responsibilities of life. But at the root of this evil is the loss of ethical and spiritual values. If it is true that the youth of today are the greatest consumers of hard drugs, then it is legitimate to ask if this is due to the kind of society in which our young people are being reared. Drug abuse impoverishes every community where it exists. It diminishes human strength and moral fibre. It undermines esteemed values. It destroys the will to live and to contribute to a better society. Drug abuse is indeed a scourge, just as much as a famine, a drought or an epidemic. Every year it reaps an increasing harvest of human lives. But the modern plague of drug addiction has not gone entirely unchecked or unopposed. We cannot close our eyes to the immensity of the evil inflicted on humanity by this tragic problem; but neither should we fail to see the many efforts, even heroic ones, which are being made to counter it. The United Nations Organization, as well as other institutions both governmental and non-governmental, have called attention internationally and regionally to the consequences of drug abuse. Conventions have been held, studies have been undertaken and other means have been employed, and the Holy See has been pleased to take an active part in these initiatives. The continuing growth of the illegal production and sale of drugs makes even more urgent the duty to expand those initiatives which seem now to be achieving concrete and positive results. It is imperative that the criminal activity of drug production and trafficking should be directly opposed and ultimately stopped. In this regard, my encouragement and admiration go to all those countries in which government leaders and citizens are truly committed to combatting the production, sale and misuse of drugs, sometimes paying a very high price, even sacrificing their own physical integrity. And I applaud all those who are working with equal determination to impart preventive education in the home, at school and in places of work. This requires some form of collaboration with agencies at the national and international level. But all of this would still not be sufficient if such political, legal and educational efforts were not accompanied by other initiatives, such as making crop substitution a feasible alternative in areas where illicit plant cultivation seems to be the only profitable or viable option available to the farmer. To provide such an alternative requires comprehensive rural development programmes, with stable infrastructures, appropriate technology and the fundamental community facilities of health care, education and so forth. Clearly, the problem of drug addiction and illicit trafficking is not unrelated to the question of human development. Special consideration must also be given to the treatment and rehabilitation of those who have become addicted to drugs or dependent on them in an unhealthy way. This requires the establishment and maintenance of institutions which can meet the specific needs of each individual victim of drug abuse. The great variety of needs represented requires the possibility of a threefold treatment: medical, social and legal. In this, the Church is ready to be of assistance, especially through the centres which she has herself established and by her cooperation with centres which are provided by other agencies. A key factor in successful rehabilitation, particularly in the case of young people, is the restoration of self-confidence and a healthy self-esteem, which provide fresh motivation based on solid moral and spiritual values. Drug abusers must be helped to re-establish trusting relationships with their family and friends. They must also be helped to resume their work, education or jobtraining. Families play a vital role in this process, as do educational, social and cultural institutions. Rehabilitation requires team work, and thus each of these should collaborate willingly with families and all concerned. I assure you that the Church wishes to offer every possible support to the many and varied efforts being made. And I wish to add a word of personal encouragement to you and the Governments and organizations that you represent. The common struggle against the plague of drug abuse and illicit trafficking is motivated by a serious spirit of mission, on behalf of humanity and for the very future of society, a mission whose success demands a mutual commitment and generous response on the part of all. May God bless your efforts and may this Conference be for the rest of the world a beacon of encouragement and hope.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Message","year":1989}

In the Liturgy of the Word in today’s Mass, we recalled Peter’s response to Jesus: “You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God”. Peter was the first to make such a public profession of faith. But, long before Peter’s profession, Mary already believed. You, Blessed Virgin of Nazareth, You, O woman of faith, You listened to the message of the Angel Gabriel. You put your trust in God’s word. You accepted in faith that the Son whom you would conceive and bear would be called “Son of the Most High” (Luc. 1, 32). On this day, Mary, Help of Christians, I entrust to you in love all the people of Zimbabwe. See the faith of those gathered here in prayer. We too have received the wonderful grace of knowing and believing in Jesus, your only Son, and the Son of God. But Mary, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, see how our faith is tested and how at times we waver. Plead with the Father on our behalf. Ask him to overshadow us with his Holy Spirit. Let the Spirit strengthen our fearful hearts and enlighten our doubting minds so that we may firmly believe, as you did, that “nothing is impossible to God” (Luc. 1, 37). O Mary, the Immaculate Conception, You yourself never sinned, and from the beginning you were preserved from sin’s harmful effects on your soul. Yet you knew the depths of human suffering and the terrible extent of evil in the world, for you stood at the foot of the Cross and shared with a Mother’s pierced heart in the Passion and Death of your Son. You know, most gentle Mother, how this nation has suffered, suffered during the War for Independence and from acts of violence in various places in the years that have followed. You are Our Lady of Peace, and this day we gladly turn to you under this title. Look upon these sons and daughters of yours, whom I confidently entrust to you today. They have known the horrors of hatred and violence. They hunger for justice and peace. They desire reconciliation and harmony among the tribes and races of Zimbabwe, among all the peoples of the earth. Your beloved Son died on the Cross “to gather together in unity the scattered children of God” (Io. 11, 52). We are a people who believe that Jesus died for us all. We believe that Jesus lives for us all. We believe that he is the Prince of Peace. Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God. Obtain for us the favour of believing ever more firmly in the Victory of the Cross, and of living in loving communion with Jesus and with all our brothers and sisters. And now, in the words of the Angelus, let us join our hearts and voices in prayer.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Angelus","year":1988}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d91eb0a910b526c92c854"},"text":"\"I rejoice when I heard them say: Let us go to God’s house\". Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, 1. With these words the whole Church proclaims her Advent joy. Today is the First Sunday of Advent. We are drawing near to that night when the shepherds in the fields around Bethlehem experienced the joy of the angels’ call to go and see the Lord: \" Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us\". Yes, again today, here in Adelaide, the Church reminds us that the Lord is at hand. And like the shepherds on that wonderful night in Bethlehem, we too say: \"Let us go to the house of the Lord \". Advent is the time of preparation for Christmas, for the coming of the Saviour. It calls us to \"go rejoicing to the house of the Lord . . . and there to praise the Lord’s name\". To praise the name of the Most High God - the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit: that is our first intention at this Eucharistic celebration. 2. \"I rejoiced when I heard them say: Let us go to God’s house\". With this same joy of the Advent Liturgy I greet all of you gathered here in Adelaide. In the name of Jesus Christ I greet you, the people of South Australia. I greet you, Archbishop Faulkner, Archbishop Gleeson, Bishop De Campo and all my brother bishops, together with the priests, religious and laity of Adelaide and Port Pirie. I greet the members of the other Christian Churches and Communions. I greet the representatives of public life. I embrace in the love of the Saviour all the children, the young, the old, the sick. At the same time I greet all the inhabitants of this continent of Australia, journeying together with you towards the Lord’s house, along the paths of that Advent which is human history - the Advent in which the whole human family and the whole of creation are awaiting the Second Coming of our Saviour Jesus Christ! Only a few years separate us from the end of the second millennium and the beginning of the third millennium of the Christian era. This is a time of grace for the Church. It is a time for us as followers of Jesus Christ, in the midst of the profound transformations affecting culture and society, to rededicate ourselves to Christian living. It is a time for the Gospel message to be proclaimed to the men and women of this age with the force of a new Pentecost. It is a time in which the Spirit of truth himself is clearly speaking words of life to the human family. 3. In the Eucharistic celebration of this First Sunday of Advent, we are praying for the fulfilment of the Father’s plan for the human family: \"In that new world where the fullness of your peace will be revealed, gather people of every race, language ad way of life to share in one eternal banquet with Jesus Christ the Lord\". In other words, we are praying for the fulfilment of the Prophet Isaiah’s vision as expressed in the first reading: \"All nations will stream to . . . the mountain of the Lord . . . that he may teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths\". The desire for that time of grace and peace is deeply rooted in our hearts. Who does not look forward eagerly to that end-time when \"nation will not lift sword against nation, (when) there will be no more training for war\". There is indeed an Advent season that is universal and lasts as long as human history. Today we meditate on Isaiah’s vision of people without number on the march to the mountain of the Lord - God’s people in every age and in every place being gathered into union with him and unity among themselves in the Church. And we should reflect on this vision as it is being realized in the concrete reality of your Australian life in the history and culture of your continent and of South Australia in particular. This Eucharistic assembly is itself a symbol of the Prophet’s vision. You are a people gathered from \"every race, language and way of life\", made one in Jesus Christ and in his Church. Australia: land of many cultures! Australia: land of different ethnic groups, shaped by the traditions, attitudes and hopes of so many people whose faith sustained them in the difficult task of making a new home on this continent! 4. Long before the Christian era, long before Moses led God’s people to freedom, long before Abraham set out for a new country to father a new nation, migrating waves of Aboriginal peoples came to this great South Land. Here they settled down in close relationship with the land which had become their home. More recently, in the last two hundred years, new migrations have been bringing to Australia people from every continent. First came settlers from Great Britain and Ireland. But within decades a multicultural community was evolving as new arrivals came from Europe and Asia. Already in the 1860s, here in the Clare Valley of South Australia, people from England, Ireland, Poland, Austria and Germany lived side by side with the Aboriginal inhabitants. In more recent times Australia has welcomed peoples from Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and other parts of Australasia. Often the victims of poverty or the devastation of war or religious persecution came here to make a new beginning in life. They faced hardship and deprivation. Out of a great deal of human misery and suffering, there is now emerging a nation filled with hope and promise. This is your history. This is the shaping of your culture as the people of Australia. In this story there is much to be proud of. It is also a story in which you recognize the need for that reconciliation which comes through Jesus Christ. All people have a right to love and value what is good in their own heritage. All people have a right to self-respect and dignity. The tensions which sometimes arise when people of differing histories, traditions, cultures and faiths seek to live side by side have to be overcome in a spirit of true openness and brotherhood. Ultimately, what is required is openness to that divine and transcendent providence which guides the nations towards a fuller recognition of unity - the unity of all who bear the image of the One who \"holds all things in unity\": Jesus Christ, \"the image of the unseen God and the firstborn of all creation\". 5. The word of God has called us to be an alert and watchful people, standing ready, clothed in the very armour of Jesus Christ: \"You know ‘the time’ has come: you must wake up now . . . The night is almost over, it will be daylight soon. Let us live decently as people do in the daytime . . . no wrangling or jealousy. Let your armour be the Lord Jesus Christ\". Every expression of hostility towards others builds a wall of tension between people and reveals a heart of stone. Every act of discrimination is an act of injustice and a violation of personal dignity. Every time we are intolerant we close our eyes to God’s image in the other person. Every time we fail to recognize the demands of worldwide justice, we fait to grasp the meaning of our universal solidarity. But when we speak with kind words, when we respect and honour one another, when we show true friendship, when we offer hospitality, when we make en effort to understand the differences between people - then we become a living sign that Isaiah’s vision is being realized, that the Kingdom of God has come among us, that the universal Advent of history is proceeding towards its fulfilment. 6. Today the Church invites each and every one of us to take willingly and joyfully the path that God has prepared for the whole human race. The Prophet Isaiah speaks of that path as going up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. A part of this \"going up\" is man’s vocation to seek full and authentic humanity, to refine and develop his spiritual and bodily qualities, while he struggles to bring the world under his control through the advancement of knowledge and through his own labour. This the human family does through cultural advancement. Men and women today are clearly aware that, more than ever before, they are called to fashion their own destiny in this world. The means to do so are increasingly available: a better understanding of the earth and its secrets; a better understanding of the movement of history and social organization; and the world of communications, which gives more and more people an opportunity to share in modern progress. A more humane world is struggling to be born. And yet, at every turn the highest hopes are accompanied by disturbing contradictions. As regards respect for fundamental human rights, the last decades have witnessed much progress and a growing awareness of the rightness of this cause. We cannot, however, overlook the fact that our world still offers too many examples of radical injustice and oppression. Were there exists a great good to be achieved, a great moral maturity and a great sense of justice are also needed. Without a vision of the sublime dignity of the human person - a dignity founded on each one’s unique relationship to the Creator and Redeemer, a dignity linked to the transcendent nature, origin and destiny of man - progress lacks a sure direction. Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life, reveals to us the real meaning of history. He reveals God’s plan for humanity. Jesus speaks to our freedom and calls us to promote truly human progress when he gives us his law of love and service: \"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you\". The Gospel purifies and strengthens all culture, thus enabling it to help man to \"go up to the mountain of the Lord . . . that he may teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths\". 7. The call of Jesus is clear. He says: \"Stay awake\". And again: \"Stand ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect\". In this way he urges all his followers to work for the goal that the Father has set: the Kingdom of justice, truth and peace. In this way he urges the faithful in Australia to help remedywhatever injustices may mar the life of their nation, and to ensure that a new spirit of reconciliation animates the entire national life. Jesus makes it clear that we will be judged on how we respond to his presence in the hungry, the naked, the sick and the imprisoned. Dear brothers and sisters: you are called to be partners with God in building up his Kingdom in the hearts of all Australians, hearts of flesh and not of stone. Our reflection today on Australia as a land of many cultures has helped us to see your history against the background of God’s eternal love for the whole human family revealed in the saving mission of Jesus Christ. It is a history still unfolding. It presents many challenges to you as a nation, to the Church in this land, and to every individual citizen. This too is the Advent, full of expectation, which the Church celebrates at this time. We go forward, as the pilgrim People of God, following Jesus who is the Way to the Father. We go forward in the certainty that his truth will set us free, and our strength comes from his words and his sacrament. 8. With eyes fixed on the One who is to come, let us also look upon this entire continent, and upon every ethnic group and every cultural tradition that belongs to it. And upon all Australia let us invoke the blessing of the Psalm: \"Peace be to your homes! May peace reign in your walls . . . For love of my brethren and friends I say: ‘Peace upon you!’ For love of the house of the Lord I will ask for your good\". For you: Adelaide! For you: Australia! For you: the entire world! And let us continue to look to him, the One who is to come, the \"Prince of Peace\". Concerning him, the prophet says: \"He will wield authority over the nations and adjudicate between many peoples; these will hammer their swords into ploughshares, their spears into sickles. Nations will not lift sword against nation, there will be no more training for war. O House of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord\". This is the light of Advent. It is the light of the Advent that stretches out before the human family until the Lord comes again in glory - the Advent of man’s responsibility for the life and for the world that the Creator has placed in his hands. The light is the light of the One who is to come, the Prince of Peace. It is the light of Christ. May the light of Christ shine upon Australia: land of many cultures! May the light of Christ shine upon each one of you. Amen.","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Homilie","year":1986}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d927c0a910b526c92c855"},"text":"Brothers and sons in Christ Jesus, I have come to celebrate with you the Four Hundredth Anniversary of the Venerable English College – to commemorate with you and your fellow-countrymen at home the four centuries in which the Catholic faith has been lived here by young men preparing for the priesthood. From this historic edifice in the City of Rome, those young men have gone forth as priests in order to pass on the faith to generations of the faithful in England and Wales. Within the sacred setting of this Eucharistic Liturgy, I wish to pay homage to this saving faith in Jesus Christ, and to honour all those whose lives have been anchored in this faith, those who, keeping their eyes fixed on Jesus, the Son of God, held fast to the confession of their faith. A living faith in Jesus Christ has been the bedrock foundation of this College and of all its activities from the time of its establishment by my predecessor Gregory XIII in 1579. The men of faith who were your predecessors here continue to inspire you by the example of their lives. Yours is a great heritage; a whole martyrum candidatus exercitus honours the beginning of your College, and spans an entire century from the time of Saint Ralph Sherwin in 1591 to Saint David Lewis in 1679. As supreme witnesses to the faith, these Martyrs speak to you today from this chapel and from every corner of this house. And the Church herself corroborates their witness and exhorts you to \"consider the outcome of their life, and imitate their faith\". And so, dear brothers and sons, this moment of joyful celebration and solemn commemoration becomes a time of prayerful reflection and a day of challenge for the rest of your lives. Like your predecessors, you yourselves are called to be priests of Jesus Christ, servants of his Gospel, and witnesses before your people to the pure Catholic faith as transmitted by the Apostles, proclaimed by the Magisterium of the Church and upheld by the martyrs and confessors of all ages. By word and example you are called to bear your Catholic witness at this juncture of history. God is calling you here and now, in the present circumstances of the Church and the world. Christ and his Church bid you, however, to face the challenge of this hour, not just with your own skill or with mere human wisdom, but with the power of the Gospel. In the words of Saint Paul, you are to take the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. Your individual and corporate witness to the faith can be essentially non different from the witness given by your Martyrs – a witness to the faith of the universal Church, a witness that will lead others to Christ, a witness that will not yield when – as Jesus tells us in the Gospel – the rains come, the floods rise, the gales blow and the house is struck. It is precisely because we have the whole armour of God and are rooted in faith that we feel strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might, equipped to proclaim the whole mystery of the Gospel and to bear witness, in the continuity of this generation, to the fullness of Catholic truth. This is the first part of your challenge today: to be witnesses to the faith. You are called by Christ and will be sent by his Church on an ecclesial mission, to bear witness to the faith in a place where, perhaps, you never dreamed of being, in a way that you never thought of. And yet, openness, readiness and calmness are what you have learned from the history of your College and, in particular, from the lives of your Martyrs. And today in this liturgy, Isaiah addresses to each one of you young men his prophetic exhortation: \"Trust in the Lord for ever, for the Lord is the everlasting Rock\". And I repeat these words to you: Trust in the Lord; trust in the Lord, in order to fulfil your role as witnesses to the faith – faith in Jesus Christ. It is good to reflect that you are likewise called to be witnesses in this generation to the vitality of the Church’s youth – to be witnesses to the power and effectiveness of Christ’s grace to capture the hearts of the young today. The world needs concrete proof that Christ can draw this generation to himself. And you must show that you have understood the meaning of life in the context of Christ’s love and his call. You are called to bear witness to the fact that, amid the thousand and one attractions and options offered by the modern world, you have been \"captured\" by Christ, to the point of giving up all the rest, in order to become his companions and disciples; in order to embrace his mission and, finally, his Cross; and in order to know the power of his Resurrection. The consideration of being witnesses to the strength of Christ’s grace leads us naturally to something that is at the summit of our very being: our own freedom. It is only through the exercise of this freedom – God’s great gift to us – that we can adequately respond to his invitation, to the call of his grace, to the love that he offers us. For each one of you the present challenge is this: to surrender your hearts and your wills to Christ under the action of the Holy Spirit, to give yourselves freely and totally and perseveringly to Christ. The Lord Jesus asks for the response of your freedom, for the oblation of your liberty. And the words of the Psalm enable you to reply: \"My heart is ready, God; my heart is ready\". Dear brothers and sons: you are therefore called to bear witness to your Catholic faith in all its purity; you are called to be witnesses to the victory of Christ’s love, not as an abstract power, but as it touches your own lives and consecrates your own freedom. For all of you this is indeed an hour for great trust. He who began in you a good work – who began a good work in this College four hundred years ago – is well able through the power of his Spirit to bring it to perfection, for the glory of his name, for the honour of his Gospel and for the good of his entire Church. And Mary, the Queen of Martyrs, the Faithful Virgin, who stood by your Martyrs and all your predecessors, will be with each of you, so that your witness may be genuine in faith and holiness. She will assist you in the role that is yours as true disciples of her Son, faithful members of the Church, diligent students of the Second Vatican Council and of all the Councils that went before. In a special way I commend to her intercession the witness that you are called to bear in truth and love before your Anglican brethren in the providential dialogue – to be sustained by prayer and penance – that is directed to the restoration of full unity in Jesus Christ and in his Church. And so, anchored in faith and committed to holiness of life, look forward with joyful confidence to a new era of your College. Sacrifice and generosity, prayer and study, humility and discipline will be as much a part of your future as they were of your past. Countless men, women and children will look to you to find Christ. From the depths of their being they will plead with you in the words of the Gospel: \"We wish to see Jesus\". Like the Apostle Philip you must show Jesus to the world – Jesus and no substitute, for there is salvation in no other name. Thus you can clearly see that the destiny of your homeland is linked with the success of the mission of this institution. The contribution that you will make to the world depends on how well you bear witness to the faith and to the power of Christ’s grace in your own lives. My beloved brothers, sons and friends: after four hundred years this College is still, by the grace of God, just as active as it ever was, and what it stands for is more relevant than ever before. And so it will remain, provided that you continue to put into practice what Jesus himself tells you when he says: Preach my Gospel. Proclaim my word. Re-enact my Sacrifice. Yes, be my witnesses. Remain in my love, today and for ever. Amen. ","pope":"John Paul II","type":"Homilie","year":1979}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d93a10a910b526c92c856"},"text":"Dear Brothers! My dear sons and daughters throughout the entire Catholic World! Having been called by the mysterious and paternal goodness of God to this awesome responsibility of the Papacy, we extend to you our greetings. At the same time we greet everyone in the world, all who hear us. Following the teachings of the Gospel, we would wish to think of you as friends, as brothers and sisters. To all of you, we wish good health, peace, mercy and love: \"May the grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.\" We are still overwhelmed at the thought of this tremendous ministry for which we have been chosen: as Peter, we seem to have stepped out on treacherous waters. We are battered by a strong wind. So we turn towards Christ saying: \"Lord, save me\" (Mt 14:30). Again we hear his voice encouraging and at the same time lovingly reminding us: \"Why do you doubt, oh you of little faith.\" If human forces alone cannot be adequate to the task before us, the help of Almighty God who has guided his Church throughout the centuries in the midst of great conflicts and opposition will certainly not desert us, this humble and most recent servant of the servants of God. Placing our hand in that of Christ, leaning on him, we have now been lifted up to steer that ship which is the Church; it is safe and secure, though in the midst of storms, because the comforting, dominant presence of the Son of God is with it. According to the words of St Augustine, an image dear to the ancient Fathers of the Church, the ship of the Church must not fear, because it is guided by Christ and by his Vicar: \"Although the ship is tossed about, it is still a ship. It carries the disciples and it receives Christ. Yes, it is tossed on the sea but without it, one would immediately perish\" (Sermon 75,3; PL 38, 475). Only in the Church is salvation: without it one perishes! We proceed then in this faith. God's assistance will not be wanting to us, just as he has promised: \"I am with you always even to the end of the world\" (Mt 28:20). The common response and willing cooperation of all of you will make the weight of our daily burden lighter. We gird ourself for this awesome task, realizing the uniqueness of the Catholic Church. Its tremendous spiritual power is the guarantee of peace and order; as such it is present in the world; as such it is recognized in the world. The echo of its daily life gives witness that, despite all obstacles, it lives in the heart of men, even those who do not share its truth or accept its message. As the Second Vatican Council (to whose teachings we wish to commit our total ministry, as priest, as teacher, as pastor) has said: \"Destined to extend to all regions of the earth, the Church enters into human history, though it transcends at once all time and all racial boundaries. Advancing through trials and tribulations, the Church is strengthened by God's grace, promised to her by the Lord so that she may not waver from perfect fidelity, but remain the worthy bride of the Lord, until, through the cross, she may attain to that light which knows no setting.\" (Lumen Gentium, 9). According to God's plan: \"All those, who in faith look towards Jesus, the author of salvation and the principle of unity and peace, God has gathered together and established as the Church, that it may be for each and everyone the visible sacrament of this saving unity\" (Ibid). In that light, we place ourselves interiorly, putting all of our physical and spiritual strength at the service of the universal mission of the Church, that is to say, at the service of the world. In other words we will be at the service of truth, of justice, of peace, of harmony, of collaboration within nations as well as rapport among peoples. We call especially on the children of the Church to understand better their responsibility: \"You are the salt of the earth, you are the light of the world\" (Mt 5:13). Overcoming internal tension which can arise here and there, overcoming the temptation of identifying ourselves with the ways of the world or the appeal of easily won applause, we are, rather, united in the unique bond of love which forms the inner life of the Church as also its external order. Thus, the faithful should be ready to give witness of their own faith to the world: \"Always be pre- pared to give a reason for the hope that is in you\" (1 Pt 3:15). The Church, in this common effort to be responsible and so respond to the pressing problems of the day, is called to give to the world that \"strengthening of the spirit\" which is so needed and which alone can assure salvation. The world awaits this today: it knows well that the sublime perfection to which it has attained by research and technology has already reached a peak, beyond which yawns the abyss, blinding the eyes with darkness. It is the temptation of substituting for God one's own decisions, decisions that would prescind from moral laws. The danger for modern man is that he would reduce the earth to a desert, the person to an automaton, brotherly love to planned collectivization, often introducing death where God wishes life. The Church, admiring yet lovingly protesting against such \"achievements\", intends, rather, to safeguard the world, that thirsts for a life of love, from dangers that would attack it. The Gospel calls all of its children to place their full strength, indeed their life, at the service of mankind in the name of the charity of Christ: \"Greater love than this no man has than that he would lay down his life for his friends\" (Jn 15:13). In this solemn moment, we intend to consecrate all that we are and all that we can achieve for this supreme goal. We will do so until our last breath, aware of the task insistently entrusted to us by Christ: \"Confirm your brothers\" (Lk 22:32). He helps then by strengthening us in our difficult challenge. We remember the example of our Predecessors, whose lovable gentle ways bolstered by a relentless strength, provide both the example and programme for the papacy: we recall in particular the great lessons of pastoral guidance left by the most recent Popes, Pius XI, Pius XII, John XXIII. With wisdom, dedication, goodness and love of the Church and the world, they have left an indelible mark on our time, a time that is both troubled and magnificent. Most of all the pontifical pastoral plan of Paul VI, our immediate Predecessor, has left a strong impression on our heart and in our memory. His sudden death was crushing to the entire world. In the manner of his prophetic style, which marked his unforgettable pontificate, he placed in clear light the extraordinary stature of a great yet humble man. He cast an extraordinary light upon the Church, even in the midst of controversy and hostility these past fifteen years. Undertaking immense labours, he worked indefatigably and without rest. He extended himself to carry into effect the Second Vatican Council and to seek world peace, the tranquility of order. Our programme will be to continue his; and his in turn was in the wake of that drawn from the great heart of John XXIII. — We wish to continue to put into effect the heritage of the Second Vatican Council. Its wise norms should be followed out and perfected. We must be wary of that effort that is generous perhaps but unwarranted. It would not achieve the content and meaning of the Council. On the other hand, we must avoid an approach that is hesitant and fearful—which thus would not realize the magnificent impulse of the renewal and of life. — We wish to preserve the integrity of the great discipline of the Church in the life of priests and of the faithful. It is a rich treasure in history. Throughout the ages, it has presented an example of holiness and heroism, both in the exercise of the evangelical virtues and in service to the poor, the humble, the defenceless. To achieve that, we place a priority on the revision of the two codes of canon law; that of the oriental tradition and that of the Latin tradition to assure the blessed liberty of children of God, through the solidarity and firmness of juridical structures. — We wish to remind the entire Church that its first duty is that of evangelization. Our Predecessor, Paul VI, presented the directions for this in his memorable document: animated by faith, nourished by the Word of God, and strengthened by the heavenly food of the Eucharist, one should study every way, seek every means \"in season and out of season\" (2 Tim 4:2), to spread the word, to proclaim the message, to announce that salvation which creates in the soul a restlessness to pursue truth and at the same time offers strength from above. If all the sons and daughters of the Church know how to be tireless missionaries of the Gospel, a new flowering of holiness and renewal would spring up in this world that thirsts for love and for truth. — We wish to continue the ecumenical thrust, which we consider a final directive from our immediate Predecessors. We watch with an unchanging faith, with a dauntless hope and with endless love for the realization of that great command of Christ: \"That they may all be one\" (Jn 17:21). His heart anxiously beats for this on the eve of his sacrifice on Calvary. The mutual relationships among the churches of the various denominations have made constant and extraordinary advances as anyone can see; yet division remains a cause for concern, and indeed a contradiction and scandal in the eyes of non-Christians and non-believers. We intend to dedicate our prayerful attention to everything that would favour union. We will do so without diluting doctrine but, at the same time, without hesitance. — We wish to pursue with patience but firmness that serene and constructive dialogue that Paul VI had at the base of his plan and programme for pastoral action. The principal theme for this was set forth in his great Encyclical Ecclesiam Suam, namely, that men, as men, should know one another, even those who do not share our faith. We trust always be ready to give witness of the faith that is ours and of the mission that Christ has given to us, \"that the world may believe\" (Jn 17:21). — We wish finally to express our support for all the laudable, worthy initiatives that can safeguard and increase peace in our troubled world. We call upon all good men, all who are just, honest, true of heart. We ask them to help build up a dam within their nations against blind violence which can only destroy and sow seeds of ruin and sorrow. So, too, in international life, they might bring men to mutual understanding to combining efforts that would further social progress, overcome hunger of body and ignorance of the mind and advance those who are less endowed with goods of this earth, yet rich in energy and desire. Brothers and dearest sons and daughters, in this awesome moment for us, yet a moment enriched by God's promise, we extend our greeting to all of our sons and daughters: we wish we could see all of them face to face, embrace them, give them courage and confidence, while asking for their understanding and prayers for us. To all then, our greeting: — to the Cardinals of the Sacred College, with whom we have shared this decisive hour. We depend upon them now, as we will in the future. We are grateful to them for their wise counsel. We appreciate the strong support that they will continue to offer us, as an extension of their consent which, through God's will has brought us to the summit of the Apostolic Office; — to all the Bishops of the Church of God, \"each of whom represents his own Church, whereas all, together with the Pope, represent the entire Church in a bond of peace, love and unity\" (Lumen Gentium, 23), and whose collegiality we strongly value. We value their efforts in the guidance of the universal Church both through the synodal structure and through the curial structure in which they share by right according to the norms established; — to all of our co-workers called to a strict response to our will and thus to an honoured activity which brings holiness of life, called to a spirit of obedience, to the works of the apostolate and to a most exemplary love of the Church. We love each of them and we encourage them to stay close to us as they were to our Predecessors in proven faithfulness. We are certain to be able to rely on their highly esteemed labours, which will be for us a great joy; — We salute the priests and faithful of the diocese of Rome, given to us upon our succession to the chair of Peter and to the unique and singular title of this Roman See \"which presides over the whole society of love (cf. St Ignatius of Antioch, Letter to the Romans, Funk 1, 252). — We salute in a special way the members of our native diocese of Belluno and those who were entrusted to our care at Venice, they are remembered as most beloved sons and daughters, and of them we think now with a sincere longing, conscious of their magnificent work for the Church and of their common commitment to the cause of the Gospel. — And we embrace all priests—especially parish priests and those dedicated to the direction of souls, often in difficult conditions or genuine poverty, yet radiating the grace of their vocation in their heroic following of Christ, \"the pastor of our souls\" (1 Pt 2:25). — We salute religious men and women, both those in contemplative and active life, who continue to make present in the world a hymn of total commitment to the Gospel ideal; and we ask them to continue to \"see well to it that the Church truly shows forth Christ through them with ever-increasing clarity to believers and unbelievers alike\" (Lumen Gentium, 46). — We salute the entire missionary Church, and we extend to all men and women, who in their outposts of evangelization dedicate themselves to the care of their brothers, our encouragement and our most loving recognition. They should know that, among all who are dear to us, they are the dearest: they are never forgotten in our prayers and thoughts, because they have a privileged place in our heart. — To the associations of Catholic Action, as also to the variously named movements which contribute with new energy to the renewal of society and the \"consecration of the world\" as a leaven in the mass (cf. Mt 13:33)—to them go all support and encouragement, because we are convinced that their work, carried out in collaboration with the hierarchy, is indispensable for the Church today. — We salute young people, the hope of tomorrow—a better, a healthier, a more constructive tomorrow—that they may know how to distinguish good from bad and, with the fresh energy that they possess, bring about the vitality of the Church and the development of the world. — We greet the families who are the \"domestic sanctuary of the Church\" (Apostolicam Actuositatem, 11), and indeed a true, actual \"domestic Church\" (Lumen Gentium, 11) in which religious vocations can flourish and holy decisions be made. It is there that one is prepared for the world of tomorrow. We exhort them to oppose pernicious ideologies of hedonism which undermine life, and instead to form strong souls endowed with generosity, balance, dedication to the common good. — We extend a particular greeting to all who are now suffering, to the sick, to prisoners, to exiles, unemployed, or who have bad fortune in life; to all upon whom restraints are placed in their practice of the Catholic faith, which they cannot freely profess except at the cost of the basic human rights of freemen and of willing, loyal citizens. In a special way our thoughts turn to the tortured land of Lebanon, to the situation in the homeland of Jesus, to the area of Sahel, to India, a land that is so tried, indeed, to all those sons, daughters, brothers and sisters who undergo privations in their social and political life or as a result of natural disasters. My brothers and sisters—all people of the world! We are all obliged to work to raise the world to a condition of greater justice, more stable peace, more sincere cooperation. Therefore we ask and beg all—from the humblest who are the connective fibres of nations to heads of state responsible for each nation—to work for a new order, one more just and honest. A dawn of hope spreads over the earth, although it is sometimes touched by sinister merchants of hatred, bloodshed, and war with a darkness which sometimes threatens to obscure the dawn. This humble Vicar of Christ, who begins his mission in fear yet in complete trust, places himself at the disposal of the entire Church and all civil society. We make no distinction as to race or ideology but seek to secure for the world the dawn of a more serene and joyful day. Only Christ could cause this dawn of a light which will never set, because he is the \"sun of justice\" (cf. Mal 4:2). He will indeed oversee the work of all. He will not fail us. We ask all our sons and daughters for the help of their prayers, for we are counting on them; and we open ourselves with great trust to the assistance of the Lord, who, having called us to be his representative on earth, will not leave us without his all-powerful grace. Mary Most Holy, Queen of the Apostles, will be the shining star of our pontificate. St Peter, the foundation of the Church (St. Ambrose, Exp. Ev. sec. Lucam, IV, 70: CSEL 32,4, p. 175), will support us through his intercession and with his example of unconquerable faith and human generosity. St Paul will guide us in our apostolic efforts directed to all the people of the earth. Our holy patrons will assist us. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, we impart to the world our first, most loving Apostolic Benediction.","pope":"John Paul I","type":"Message","year":1978}

In fact, “the Holy Spirit sanctifies and leads the people of God and enriches it with virtues, but, \"allotting his gifts to everyone according as He wills, (1 Cor 12:11) He distributes special graces among the faithful of every rank. By these gifts He makes them fit and ready to undertake the various tasks and offices which contribute toward the renewal and greater expansion of the Church” (LG 12). Teresa of Jesus, great and noble virgin, and also reformer of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, was enriched by profusion of this divine abundance of sacred charisms. A woman of simple customs and ignorant of literary culture, she excelled so much in words and writings that these words can be referred to her: “in the full assembly she opened her mouth” (Sir 15:5), and she was rightly proclaimed a saint by holy men and also was venerated as a very sure guide and teacher by doctors of sacred sciences. Although she was involved in a great deal of business related to her duties, it was nevertheless seen that she constantly aspired to a better homeland, that is to say, to a heavenly homeland; almost always suffering in her body and laden with tribulations, she fearlessly faced any undertaking for the glory of God and for the benefit of Christ’s Church. Therefore, since this servant of God always has been exalted, whether for the extraordinary facts of her life, the rare virtues of her soul, or for the acumen of her spirit, we consider with certainty this fact a just and noble reason wherefore, as our predecessor Gregory XV’s decree bestowed upon her the honours of the saints so that all the faithful of Christ might understand with what abundance God had filled his servant with the Holy Spirit (cf. Lett. Decr. Omnipotens sermo), so should we proclaim her — we do not doubt — a Doctor of the Church, first among women, especially for her knowledge and doctrine of divine things. In fact, we have faith and trust that Teresa of Jesus, declared by solemn decree a teacher of Christian life, strongly will encourage the men of our time as well to cultivate above all that which favours the soul’s love towards contemplation and the attainment of heavenly things. Teresa was born in Avila, Spain, on 28 March 1515. Even as a child she gave a glimpse of what she one day would become because she tried to lead a hidden life in the gardens of her house, as she was willing to observe until death that which she often read about the martyrs of the early Church. After her mother's death at a young age, she procured help and protection from the Mother of God herself. It was therefore natural for her that from her childhood she wanted to consecrate herself totally to God and that, at the age of twenty, she went to the Carmelite monastery. Although she applied herself assiduously, by many sure indications, to the exercise of the virtues, she nevertheless began to relax her soul’s early fervour and to move away from her purpose. Fortunately, she then was drawn with intensity to the consideration of heavenly realities and to doing the most perfect and greatly accepted works for God, following the exhortations of Peter of Alcantara, Louis Bertrand, Francis Borgia, John of Avila, and other saints. And she cultivated and completed this decision with magnanimity, as witnessed both by her confessors and by those who were useful to her in her life and works. She seemed, however, to be called upon to sustain extraordinary tasks, to which her ingenuity and a certain natural inclination of her will led her. In fact, she was motivated by the constant and resolute intention to ensure that the monastery of her Order was governed according to the more ancient rule, which had fallen into disuse; and, with the approval of the Holy See, she brought this to a successful conclusion at the age of 47, after having consulted learned men and saints. When difficulties arose on all sides, she overcame them so courageously and persisted so firmly along the way that in a few years she founded many more monasteries in Spain. In addition, in order to provide the reformed monasteries of the nuns in a more appropriate way and to help the growth of the Church with apostolic works, she decided to call male religious subject to the Order of Carmel to a higher discipline of life as well, and she carried out her plan with the support and help of Saint John of the Cross. After having thus founded and increased the order, she dedicated herself to training the pious women in the method of a holy life, whom she had welcomed daily in greater numbers so that they might live hidden and alone with God, address to him assiduous prayers for the Church, mortify their bodies with frequent and voluntary sufferings, be united with each other by affectionate kindness and charity in order to obey the special commandment of Christ. She was also an excellent incitement and example in the exercise of all the virtues. In fact, she was distinguished by prudence and evangelical simplicity, humility of spirit, obedience to superiors even in difficult things, contempt for herself, and a particular inclination for the good of others and, in order to help them, she did not hesitate to sacrifice herself and her things. She also led an austere and hard life, patient in adverse events, very grateful to God in happy ones. She also shone with ardent piety towards God, intimately moved by his love. Filled, in turn, by God with countless graces, nevertheless, she fully embraced the Church's counsels, valuing much more faithful and humble obedience to God's ministers than visions, revelations, and ecstasies. Because of this assiduous familiarity with God, it is said that something radiant seemed to shine on her face that caused wonder and joy in everyone. It was necessary to add to this the human virtues, which Teresa is said to have cultivated, because she made a strong effort to tell the truth, to keep her word, to fulfill her promises, to have a manner of speech, even a familiar one, that was full of joy and kindness. She truly excelled in what she had to do or sustain, in her greatness of mind, as well as in her equal esteem and respect for everyone. It should not be forgotten that among her commitments and continuous efforts she also found the time and strength to write excellent works, which seemed totally to demand and occupy the entire existence of a very active person, an acute and penetrating seeker of profound questions concerning God and heavenly things. At Alba, a brief, fatal illness finally struck her, who had exhausted herself for so long and so actively, and it forced her to desist from other initiatives. The magnanimous mother died piously on 4 October 1582, repeatedly testifying to her obsequy as a most loving daughter for Christ’s Church. She, who during her life had been praised everywhere for her singular virtues, came after her death to the fore and was venerated with greater splendour. And it was rightly so that she should be given the honours of the blessed who dwell in heaven by Paul V, and the honours of the saints by Gregory XV, and that she should be proposed as an example of Christian and religious life, to whom everyone could turn their eyes. If we are attracted to imitate the holiness of this servant of God, we are taken with great admiration by the excellence of her teaching. In fact, although she had repeatedly declared her inability to understand and teach, she was nevertheless able to understand, teach and write, inspired by God, on very profound subjects, considering Christ the only source of her doctrine and almost a living book. With regard to this, it is above all a marvellous thing that Saint Teresa should have penetrated the mystery of Christ and the knowledge of the human soul with such acuity and sagacity so that her doctrine clearly indicates the certain presence and strength of a singular charism of the Spirit. For in this doctrine excels a very deep sense of reality, an intimate understanding of the mystery of the living God, of Christ the Saviour and the Church, a living experience of grace, which raises and develops nature, adorned with so many gifts. Hence, the supreme effectiveness and perennial authority of her doctrine, which extends beyond the confines of the Catholic Church and reaches even those who do not believe.","pope":"John Paul I","type":"Apostolic Letter","year":1970}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d94840a910b526c92c858"},"text":"Dear Sons and Daughters, At a time when we are still filled with the spirit and graces of the Holy Year, we are beginning the liturgical season of Lent. Lent is the special period for spiritual reflection – a period in which each person is invited to examine himself or herself in prayer, and to act. Let us make a sincere effort to prepare ourselves to re-live, in union with the Church, the mysteries of Christ who suffered, died and rose again for the Church herself and for all people. Dear sons and daughters, this is why “we beg once again not to neglect the grace of God”(2 Cor 6:1) – God who is love and self-giving. And we repeat to you the exhortation which we put forward as one of the conclusions of the Holy Year: “Love the brethren! Love those who need your love and your service (cf. 1 Jn 4:19-21). This will be fraternal and social love – revived and multiplied in good works – which will not only manifest our faithful commitment to the Holy Year, but will also manifest the fruitfulness and relevance of the Holy Year in the years to come…” (Address at the General Audience of 17 December 1975: L’Osservatore Romano of 18 December 1975). In order that you may have a part in establishing justice, and in order that the Gospel of love may have witness, we ask you to share what you have with those around you. Those who are truly poor always find someone who is poorer still. And share generously in the help that the Churches give to one another. Do this by responding to the yearly appeal that will be made to you by your local Church, for the purpose of helping the people – even though they may be far away from you – who are suffering from hunger and want. Through your generosity you will be purified, and then you will be ready to enter into the life of Easter, a life lived in the spirit of the Risen Lord. It is with this hope, dear sons and daughters, of the entire world, that we bless you: in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

{"_id":{"$oid":"610d977b0a910b526c92c859"},"text":"Venerable brethren, Dear children: Christmas is with Us, the second Christmas of Our pontificate. Gazing at the scene from afar, united in spirit with Mary and Joseph on the road to Bethlehem, We taste a few days in advance the sweetness which comes to Us from the angelic hymn announcing the heavenly peace which is offered to all men of good will. And thus, from day to day, We reflect that the road to Bethlehem truly marks the path for the right approach to that peace which is on the lips, in the eager desires and in the hearts, of all. The appeal of the liturgy, in the words of Pope Leo the Great, was already giving a warning to us with the joyous invitation: \"Exult in the Lord, dear people; lift up your hearts in spiritual joy, for the day of redemption is being renewed, the day of age-long expectation, of the announcement of the happiness that has no end\" (20th sermon on the Lord's Nativity P.L., 54, 193). And along with it—as if in chorus with that solemn and touching voice which comes to us from the fifth century—we hear rising in unison, as it were, the imploring voice of the supreme pontiffs who ruled the Church both before and after the two wars that tore humanity apart in our generation. We hear the very recent words of the 19 Christmas messages of our Holy Father, Pius XII of ever dear and happy memory. We hear an unending invitation, then, to hasten our steps along the roads to Bethlehem, which are the roads of peace for us. In the world of today, how many roads of peace have been proposed and imposed? And how many roads have been suggested even to Us, who rejoice indeed, with Mary and Joseph, in the sure knowledge of Our path and have no fear of the possibility of going astray? From World War II right up to the present time, what a variety of utterances, what an abuse of this sacred word: \"peace, peace\" (Jer. 6:14). We pay homage to the good will of the many guides and proclaimers of peace in the world: statesmen, experienced diplomats and influential writers. But human efforts in the matter of universal peace-making are still far from the point where heaven and earth meet. The fact is that true peace cannot come save from God. It has only one name: the peace of Christ. It has one aspect, that impressed on it by Christ who, as if to anticipate the counterfeits of man, emphasized: \"Peace I leave you, my peace I give to you\" (John 14:28). Christian peace The appearance of peace is threefold: Peace of the heart: Peace is before all else an interior thing, belonging to the spirit, and its fundamental condition is a loving and filial dependence on the will of God. \"Thou hast made us for Thyself, O Lord, and our heart is restless till it rests in Thee\" (St. Augustine's Confessions, 1, I, 1, 1, P.L., 32, 661). All that weakens, that breaks, that destroys this conformity and union of wills is opposed to peace. First of all and before all is wrongdoing, sin. \"Who hath resisted him and hath had peace?\" (Job 9:4). Peace is the happy legacy of those who keep the divine law. \"Much peace have they who love thy law\" (Psalms 118:165). For its part, good will is only the sincere determination to respect the eternal laws of God, to conform oneself to His commandments and to follow His paths—in a word, to abide in the truth. This is the glory which God expects to receive from man. \"Peace to men of good will.\" Social peace: This is solidly based on the mutual and reciprocal respect for the personal dignity of man. The Son of God was made man, and His redeeming act concerns not only the collectivity, but also the individual man. He \"loved me and gave himself up for me.\" Thus spoke St. Paul to the Galatians (Gal. 2:20). And if God has loved man to such a degree, that indicates that man is of interest to Him and that the human person has an absolute right to be respected. Such is the teaching of the Church which, for the solution of these social questions, has always fixed her gaze on the human person and has taught that things and institutions—goods, the economy, the state—are primarily for man; not man for them. The disturbances which unsettle the internal peace of nations trace their origins chiefly to this source: that man has been treated almost exclusively as a machine, a piece of merchandise, a worthless cog in some great machine or a mere productive unit. It is only when the dignity of the person comes to be taken as the standard of value for man and his activities that the means will exist to settle civil discord and the often profound divisions between, for example, employers and the employed. Above all, it is only then that the means will exist to secure for the institution of the family those conditions of life, work and assistance which are capable of making it better directed to its function as a cell of society and the first community instituted by God Himself for the development of the human person. No peace will have solid foundations unless hearts nourish the sentiment of brotherhood which ought to exist among all who have a common origin and are called to the same destiny. The knowledge that they belong to the same family extinguishes lust, greed, pride and the instinct to dominate others, which are the roots of dissensions and wars. It binds all in a single bond of higher and more fruitful solidarity. International peace: The basis of international peace is, above all, truth. For in international relations, too, the Christian saying is valid: \"The truth shall make you free\" (John 8:32). It is necessary, then, to overcome certain erroneous ideas: the myths of force, of nationalism or of other things that have prevented the integrated life of nations. And it is necessary to impose a peaceful living together on moral principles, according to the teaching of right reason and of Christian doctrine. Along with this, and enlightened by truth, should come justice. This removes the causes of quarrels and wars, solves the disputes, fixes the tasks, defines the duties and gives the answer to the claims of each party. Justice in its turn ought to be integrated and sustained by Christian charity. That is, love for one's neighbor and one's own people ought not to be concentrated on one's self in an exclusive egotism which is suspicious of another's good. But it ought to expand and reach out spontaneously toward the community of interests, to embrace all peoples and to interweave common human relations. Thus it will be possible to speak of living together, and not of mere coexistence which, precisely because it is deprived of this inspiration of mutual dependence, raises barriers behind which nestle mutual suspicion, fear and terror. Errors of man in his search for peace Peace is a gift of God beyond compare. Likewise, it is the object of man's highest desire. It is moreover indivisible. None of the lineaments which make up its unmistakable appearance can be ignored or excluded. In addition, since the men of our time have not completely carried into effect the conditions of peace, the result has been that God's paths toward peace have no meeting point with those of man. Hence there is the abnormal situation of this postwar period which has created, as it were, two blocs with all their uneasy conditions. There is not a state of war, but neither is there peace, the thing which the nations ardently desire. At all times, because true peace is indivisible in its various aspects, it will not succeed in establishing itself on the social and international planes unless it is also, and in the first place, an interior fact. This requires then before all else—it is necessary to repeat—\"men of good will.\" These are precisely those to whom the angels of Bethlehem announced peace: \"Peace among men of good will.\" (Luke 2:14). Indeed they alone can give reality to the conditions contained in the definition of peace given by St. Thomas: The ordered harmony of citizens (Contra Gentiles 3, (III), CCC 146) and therefore order and harmony. But how will true peace be able to put forth the two-fold blossom of order and concord if the persons who hold positions of public responsibility, before selecting the advantages and risks of their decisions, fail to recognize themselves as persons subject to the eternal moral laws? It will be necessary again and again to remove from the path the obstacles placed by the malice of man. And the presence of these obstacles is noted in the propaganda of immorality, in social injustice, in forced unemployment, in poverty contrasted with the luxury of those who can indulge in dissipation, in the dreadful lack of proportion between the technical and moral progress of nations, and in the unchecked armaments race, where there has yet to be a glimpse of a serious possibility of solving the problem of disarmament. The work of the Church The most recent events have created an atmosphere of so-called disengagement which has caused hopes to blossom anew in many minds after life has been lived for so long in a state of fictitious peace, in a situation of very great instability that more than once has been threatened with a complete rupture. All that makes obvious how rooted in the souls of all is the craving for peace. In order that this common desire may be promptly fulfilled the Church prays confidently to Him who rules the destinies of nations and can direct the hearts of rulers to good. No daughter of the world, but living and working in the world, the Church, as it has from the dawn of Christianity—as St. Paul wrote to Timothy: offers \"prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings...for all men, for kings, and for all in high positions, that we may live a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and worthy behavior\" (I Tim. 2:1-2). So also today the Church accompanies with prayer the peaceful solution of controversies, the establishment of relations between nations and their mutual collaboration, just as it helps peaceful discussions in international relations. Besides prayer, the Church makes available its maternal offices, points to the incomparable treasure of its doctrine and urges its children to lend their active cooperation for peace by recalling St. Augustine's famous invitation: \"It is more glorious to slay war with words than men with steel; and it is true glory to secure peace by peaceful means\" (St. Augustine, Epistle 129, II). It is a function and office proper to the Church that it should devote itself to peace. And the Church is aware of having omitted nothing that was within its capacities to obtain peace for nations and individuals. The Church looks with favor on every initiative which can help to spare humanity new conflicts, new massacres and incalculable new destruction. Unfortunately, the causes which have disturbed, and now disturb, international order have not yet been removed. It is therefore necessary to dry up the sources of evil. Otherwise the dangers to peace will remain a constant threat. The causes of international sickness were clearly proclaimed by Our predecessor, Pius XII of immortal memory, especially in his Christmas messages of 1942 and 1943. It is well to repeat them. These causes are: the violation of the rights and dignity of the human person and the overruling of the rights of the family and of labor; the overthrow of the juridical order and of the healthy idea of the state in keeping with the Christian spirit; impairment of the liberty, integrity and security of other nations to whatever extent; the systematic oppression of the cultural and language characteristics of national minorities; the egotistical calculations of all who strive to seize control of the economic sources of the materials of common use to the detriment of other peoples; and in particular, the persecution of religion and of the Church. It needs still to be noted that the peace which the Church prays for cannot possibly be achieved if it is mistaken for a yielding or a relaxation of its firmness in the face of ideologies and systems of life which are in open and irreconcilable opposition to Catholic teaching. Nor does peace denote indifference to the laments which come to Us even now from the unhappy lands where the rights of man are ignored and falsehood is adopted as a system. Still less can one forget the sorrowful Calvary of the Church of Silence; where the confessors of the Faith, rivaling the early Christian martyrs, are endlessly exposed to sufferings and torments for the cause of Christ. These established facts put one on guard against excessive optimism. But they render all the more earnest Our prayers for a truly universal return to respect for human and Christian liberty. Oh! May all men of good will return to Christ and listen to His divine teaching which is the teaching of His Vicar on Earth and of the lawful pastors, the bishops. They shall find the truth which frees from error, falsehood and deceit, and which will hasten the attainment of the peace of Bethlehem, that peace which was announced by the angels to men of good will. Exhortation and paternal wishes With such a wish and with such a prayer, behold we have arrived, all of us, like Mary and Joseph, like the humble shepherds from the hills around Bethlehem and like the Wise Men from the East, before the crib of our Newborn Savior. O Jesus, how tenderly we approach the simple crib! How sweet and devout are our hearts and feelings! How eager is our desire to unite all our labors in the great work of universal peace in Thy presence, Divine Author and Prince of Peace! At Bethlehem all men must find their place. In the first rank should be Catholics. Today especially the Church wishes to see them pledged to an effort to make His message of peace a part of themselves. And the message is an invitation to check the direction of every act by the dictates of divine law, which demands the unflinching adherence of all, even to the point of sacrifice. Along with such a deepened understanding must go action. It is utterly intolerable for Catholics to restrict themselves to the position of mere observers. They should feel clothed, as it were, with a mandate from on high. The effort, no doubt, is long and arduous. But Christmas means to all the certainty that nothing of men's good will is lost in whatever they perform in good will, perhaps without being entirely aware of it, for the coming of God's kingdom on earth and in order that the city of man may be modeled after the city of God. Ah, the city—the \"city of God\"—which St. Augustine hailed as resplendent with the truth that saves, with the charity that gives life and with the eternity that reassures! (Cf. Epistle 138, 3; P.L. 33, 533). Venerable brethren and dear children, scattered throughout the whole world, the final sentiments expressed in this second message recall to Us the first message which We addressed to the world on December 23, 1958. A year ago the new successor of St. Peter, still trembling under the first emotions of the lofty mission conferred on him as pastor of the Universal Church, somewhat shy about the name of John which he had chosen for himself in token of a good will that was at once anxious yet firm with regard to the program for preparing the ways of the Lord, suddenly thought of the valleys to be filled and the mountains to be brought low, and he began to advance on his way. And then, day by day, he was to recognize in great humility of spirit that truly the hand of the Most High was with him. The spectacle of religious and devout throngs, who from every part of the world gathered here in Rome or at Castelgandolfo to greet him, to hear him and to beg his blessing, was constant and touching, often giving cause for surprise and wonder. We have also been offered gifts which We treasure with lively feelings of gratitude. Among the most pleasing and significant of these gifts is a genuine old Venetian painting, the subject of which is a sacred conversation: Mary and Joseph with Jesus, and an attractive little St. John offering a ripe fruit to Jesus who, in the act of accepting the fruit with a tender smile, diffuses a celestial sweetness over the whole painting. The picture now occupies a place of honor and has become familiar to Us during Our daily prayer in Our private oratory. Allow Us, venerable brethren and dear children, to draw from this painting a most happy inspiration for Our Christmas greeting which, with sincere and friendly regard, We are pleased to extend to all members of the Holy Church and to the whole world. Thoughts concerning the peace of Bethlehem hold a foremost place among Our anxieties. But that sacred conversation widens its scope before Our eyes until it gathers around itself all those who, with Us and with you, in the spirit of the universal ministry entrusted to Our humble person, are particularly dear to us in the intimate love of Christ. We mean those who suffer from anxieties and miseries of life and to whom Christmas brings a sweet ray of comfort and hope: the sick and the infirm, who are the object of assiduous and watchful attention and very special affection; those who are suffering in spirit or in their hearts because of the uncertainties of the future, of economic hardships or of the humiliation imposed upon them because of some fault committed or presumed; the little children, especially dear to Jesus, who through their very weakness and fragility exact a more inviolable respect and require more delicate attention; and the aged, often tempted by moments of melancholy or by the thought that they are useless. Confronted by this picture, the Church pledges her prayer and her attention, as well as the solicitude of her apostolate, to all those who are particularly dear to her. She pledges these things not to them alone, but also to all whose state of life is undistinguished, to the poor, to workers, to employers, and to those who are vested with public and civil power. And how could We omit remembrance on this day before Christmas Eve of Our venerable bishops, both of the Latin and Oriental Rites, the sweetness of whose fervor for personal sanctification and dedication to souls We have frequently tasted in our fraternal meetings? How could We omit the generous and heroic bands of missionary men and women and of catechists, the compact and noble army of the diocesan and religious clergy, the religious women belonging to innumerable and praiseworthy institutes, and the Catholic laity, all on fire with zeal for works of Christian piety, of manifold types of assistance, of charity and education? Nor do We wish to forget Our separated brethren for whom Our prayers rise unceasingly to Heaven so that the promise of Christ may be fulfilled: one Shepherd and one flock. The Pope's task is to prepare for God a perfect people (Luke 1:17) which is exactly like the task of (John) the Baptist, who is his patron and from whom he takes his name. And it is not possible to imagine a higher and more precious perfection than that of Christian peace, which is the peace of hearts, peace in the social order, in life, in prosperity, in mutual respect and in the brotherhood of all nations. Venerable brethren, dear children, for this peace of Christ, the abundant and enlightening peace of Christmas, it is Our delight once more to express Our wishes and to impart Our blessing.","pope":"John XXIII","type":"Message","year":1959}

Your coming to the solemnities of Our Coronation is indeed a joint action that We have greatly appreciated, as much for the eagerness of your governments in having themselves represented at these pontifical festivities as for the number and the quality of the extraordinary delegations that you constitute. How could We not be deeply responsive to such a gesture of veneration toward the Holy See and Our person? Therefore, before all else, We wish to ask you kindly to be the interpreters of Our grateful sentiments toward your Sovereigns and Chiefs of State. The liturgical ceremony at which you assisted yesterday renewed time honored rites, and for this reason it recalls the long tradition of the Church and its history so closely connected with that of your own nations. And, at the same time, your presence at this ceremony was in Our eyes a living sign of the cordial and fruitful relations that the Apostolic See has today, as in the past, with so many countries that are anxious to see the highest spiritual values developing in their midst and for their own happiness. We thank God for thus giving Us, on the threshold of Our Pontificate, such legitimate reason for confidence in the good relations that We want to have with your countries. Moreover, in seeing your numerous delegations, here from the most different and most distant countries, and today gathered around Our person, how could We not express from an ardent heart the wish – already formulated many times and always abounding in hope – for a just and fraternal peace among nations? And here We recall, with emotion that you understand, the great figure of Our venerated Predecessor: for almost twenty years, without ever allowing himself to be disheartened by events that were sometimes cruel, he made the ideal of a peaceful order among nations resplendent in the eyes of men, worked perseveringly to establish it in the world, and constituted himself the fearless defender of the most sacred rights of individuals and of nations. The same ideal animates Us, by virtue of the sacred obligations that We have received, and We will dedicate Our strength to serve it. What a comfort for Us, gentlemen, on the day after Our Coronation, to be able to confide to you this intention, which is dear to Us, and to express in your presence the hope that in the world there may advance the great interests of peace, of justice, and of true liberty, so consistent with the teachings of the Divine Founder of the Church! Your presence strengthens Our hope, and We are grateful to you for it. So it is with special good will that We call upon you gentlemen, upon your countries and those who govern them, a generous shower of heavenly favors. Gladly do We give you in pledge of them, our Apostolic Benediction.","pope":"John XXIII","type":"Speech","year":1958}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d98560a910b526c92c85b"},"text":"It is a fact that, despite the improvements gained in recent times, the problem of food remains crucial for a large part of humanity. As you state in your reports, the current situation of the world from the agricultural viewpoint is characterized by an accentuated imbalance between the developed areas and the insufficiently developed countries. On one hand production is growing rapidly, levels of consumption are rising, exports are increasing; white on the other hand, in the Far East most particularly, production remained weak, food deficient, and imports limited. The possibility of famine and of its terrible consequences does not cease to haunt millions of people and a period of drought suffices to release this fearful scourge. But furthermore, it is necessary also to take account of the steady rise in the population which requires, at the risk of seeing things go from bad to worse, a parallel growth in consumer goods. Your organization takes upon itself to face this difficult situation, and to engage in a decisive struggle worldwide to suppress the sufferings and the threats which still today weigh on so many unfortunate people. What courage it requires to dare calmly to envisage an undertaking which without exaggeration can be called gigantic; and to give oneself to it with ardor, when it seems to grow more complex ion direct proportion to one's attachment to it. But you, animated by a zeal which nothing seems to tire, have succeeded in the first place in assuring yourselves an indispensable basis of work, obtaining the necessary information on the agricultural production and exchanges of the various countries. In many cases, in order to procure for yourselves precise indications, it has been necessary to train experts and initiate them in modem statistical methods. You have thus brought together valuable materials which will render great service to the economists. The essential part of your work consists of intervening effectively in the domain of agriculture, but also of fisheries and of forest exploitation. Without doubt efforts will be made to direct toward the undernourished peoples, which represent 70% of the world population, the excess production of the more favoured countries, thereby assuring them stable outlets. But it is much more urgent to provide for the increased productivity of those very places where famine is felt. For that, you want first to reduce the sometimes considerable losses due to the inexperience of the growers, and due to epidemics; then to raise yields by improvement of the methods of cultivation, by the use of fertilizers, by the choice of plant species; and finally you are looking toward bringing into use areas still uncultivated, especially by means of irrigation. In all of this, the phases of realization are necessarily preceded by investigations and detailed studies to evaluate the possibilities of success and to avoid the heavy consequences of errors. Let us mention equally, as an example of the cultural impact of your efforts, the task given to you by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, to put into effect an increased production of paper. This program, so varied and so broad, certainly raises unusual difficulties. Perhaps the most delicate, you have surely noticed, will consist in creating social conditions which will enable the workers to whom you will be furnishing aid and advice, to acquire a taste for their task, become interested in it, and exploit to the fullest the resources which will be provided to them. It is useless in effect to put in place experts to teach new methods and to perfect the mechanical equipment, if the human conditions in which man moves prevent him from obtaining from his effort the fruit he has a right to expect from it. To arouse interest and personal initiative, to show that the good of the community will not be realized at the expense of the good of individuals but rather to their profit. and to see to it that progress is thereby achieved, this certainly is a capital element of success. Thus, your economic work doubles itself with a social value that is not less decisive and which we love to emphasize. This is why we, desirous of demonstrating to you our support in this enterprise. have wished recently to bring our contribution in favor of the program for extending technical assistance to various countries, especially to the least fortunate regions. In spite of the still limited resources of your organization, you have not hesitated to interest in it all people, who are avid not only to perfect themselves and to obtain economic advantages but also to bring their help to those less fortunate. An action of this sort, as we remarked in an address pronounced on the 21st of February 1948 in circumstances similar to these, obliges nations to feel themselves mutual beneficiaries and benefactors of one another. The civilized world looks with a profound sadness at pitiful pictures of victims of famine when the earth is capable of feeding all mankind. To suppress definitively such a wound certainly merits some sacrifice and justifies austere dedication. Was not Christ concerned to satisfy the hunger of the crowds which were following him? Did He not teach to His disciples the prayer which asks of God our daily bread? In pursuing the goal which you have set yourselves, you are realizing without any doubt an intention dear to Him who consecrated Himself to the salvation of humanity. That is why we wish that you may continue your task without weakening. It is no doubt only at its start, but already experience has taught you much; your tools are perfecting themselves, your credit is growing among governments who are appreciating more and more the usefulness and the fruits of your action. If the final term is not yet in view, at least you can hope that a wider comprehension and a more active collaboration will come to re-enforce and multiply the results obtained and to guarantee a more rapid further development. We wish this for you with all our heart, at the same time that we call down upon you, your families and upon all who share in your labor the most abundant blessings of Heaven.","pope":"Pius XII","type":"Speech","year":1953}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d987a0a910b526c92c85c"},"text":"Dearly beloved in Jesus Christ. Just ten years ago We knelt in the sanctuary of your St. Patrick's cathedral. Beneath the aspiring arches, in the dim light falling from windows of the Lady Chapel, We prayed at the tomb of those revered prelates, whose memory carries the mind back over a century and more of extraordinary progress made from small and humble beginnings along a path not infrequently roughened by lack of workers, by poverty and calumny and even persecution. They were valiant champions of truth, those successors of the Apostles in governing the great diocese of New York, respected and well-deserving citizens of the country and city they loved. In God's kind providence their mantle has fallen on worthy shoulders. But the commemoration you are celebrating this morning overleaps that century of vast and rapid growth, reaching back to the days when Manhattan Island counted hardly more than a thousand citizens, and marauding, inhuman tribes terrorized the upper sections of the country. Then it was that the first priest set foot in the colony that was later to become the metropolis of the new world. A ransomed captive, Father Jogues was leaving for a time his mission among the Mohawks; but he would return. Human language falters in the attempt to describe the ghastly tortures of a year-long captivity; the human soul shudders and recoils before the repeated scenes of gashing and stabbing, of beating and burning, distending and mutilating, that with a superhuman endurance he had borne for thirteen months. But he would return. For his heart never ceased to be captive of the love of God. It was the love of God and God's love of souls that had laid hold on the young stripling of seventeen years and planted it in the garden of religious life. That same love tightened its grip on his expanding heart, as he heard of the hard and rigorous mission across the sea among the savages of forest and plain, who nevertheless, he knew, were human souls needing the redeeming grace of Christ's passion and death. They had been offered for them as well as for cultured Europe. Isaac Jogues was only 29 years old when he first landed at Quebec; he was thirty-seven when he returned after a six months absence in Europe, and two years later — he was not yet forty — his brief life was crowned with the glorious triumph of dying a martyr for Christ. He shared that glory with his two heroic, ever-loyal companions. They were not priests, John Lalande and René Goupil; they were of the laity, one a doctor, the other a carpenter; but they were inspired by the same love of God and God's love of souls; their characters had been formed in the same mould of selfless courage, their ambitions stretched upwards to the same lofty ideals of sacrifice and self-dedication to the cause of the Heart of Christ. They did not want to go to heaven alone. Their faith was too precious not to wish to share it with others. Their sense of being Catholic was incomplete, did it not make them conscious of a duty to all the peoples of the world. The missionary spirit, they knew it, is not a virtue of supererogation expected of the chosen few. Missionary spirit and Catholic spirit are one and the same. Catholicity is an essential mark of the true Church; so that one is not genuinely interested in and devoted to the Church unless one is interested in and devoted to its universality, that is to its taking root and flourishing everywhere on earth. Those two laymen, like their priest leader, were restless with the thought that millions knew not Christ. O blessed three! Their bones rest together treasured in nature's own reliquary, the verdant hill that slopes gently up from the quiet, easy-flowing river of the Mohawks. But those martyrs are not the possession of New York State alone. They belong to the whole nation. They were not the only missionaries martyred for the faith in America; but they are the first raised to the altars, given by the Church under God to be patrons of the land made fertile by their blood, to be an inspiration of those who have been made stronger by their death. Their message of missionary zeal, fired by the love of God and God's love of souls, is louder and more insistent at this hour, when war and war's aftermath have decimated so many ranks of missionaries and clogged so many sources of mission help. That message rings out across your blessed country, so providentially spared the horrors and destruction of other lands: from coast to coast, from the Gulf to the northern frontier and beyond, it is heard. Let men pause and hearken to its appeal. It is America's hour. The missions await the response. St. Isaac, St. John, St. Rene, look down with heaven-born love on the faithful who fill the land you longed to conquer for Christ. Through your powerful intercession before the throne of God obtain for them all the grace to share something of the spirit that was yours on earth. May the clergy and religious intensify their interior life of prayer and self-abnegation, for in such soil missionary zeal springs up and grows quickly. May the youth, that American youth always so ready and eager to throw themselves whole-heartedly into every worthy and noble venture, for whom obstacles are but a challenge to their courage, may they seize the torch of faith, lighted by you in the wildernesses, and carry it full-flaming to the ends of the earth, until all men may see and know Jesus Christ, the divine Master who has loved them with an eternal love, whom you, oh blessed martyrs, now contemplate with ineffable joy. That this Our most earnest prayer may find generous response in the souls of all the faithful of America, a land dear to Us on many counts, We invoke on them with deepest affection of Our paternal heart the Apostolic Benediction.

{"_id":{"$oid":"610d99460a910b526c92c85d"},"text":"We have little to add to the beautiful and luminous words of Our beloved son, comm. Bartolomeo Nogara, who shows such good knowledge, appreciation and love for the art treasures entrusted to him. What has been done is now in your eyes; it will be more completely in a moment. It seemed to us to be our duty to do things not with luxury - always censurable, more than ever in these times and places - but with a certain, at once severe and serene magnificence. We owed it to the immense and inestimable treasure of the great and beautiful and magnificent things kept here. We owed it to Our glorious Predecessors in this Apostolic See, always solicitous of Art, of true and great Art, because it never forgets the profound, mutual relations that bind it to Religion. We owed it perhaps even to Our Successors, relieving them once and for all of the responsibilities and concerns, which over the years and centuries have become increasingly serious and nagging, for the preservation and display of so many masterpieces, the glory of the Religion that inspired and favoured them, the glory of the geniuses who conceived and followed them, the glory and inestimable patrimony of Civilisation and Humanity. We will say at once that Our greatest satisfaction remains that of having, for three years or more, given work to so many good and skilled workers, and this in particularly difficult times. And we say good and good workers, because the work they have done attests to this, and We can also attest to it visually, having been with them almost every day. We think that our satisfaction and pleasure is shared by the great spirits who, with their works, have come to live in the new building destined for them and built for them. And perhaps the great Raphael, present in spirit in the hall sacred to him, says: \"They do me honour and they do well\". And the great Michelangelo will be able to think and be pleased that the enchanting balcony, which we shall shortly overlook, was built on purpose to admire, from a place of art and from an incomparable point of view, that marvellous masterpiece of his, the great dome, which is more beautiful to see after the learned, delicate and provident care that the creator of the balcony has given it: of the balcony and of all the rest, the architect Luca Beltrami, who was thus also able to happily fill the gap that has just been pointed out to us, since the Vatican Pinacoteca lacks a painting by Michelangelo. Now, the most beautiful painting in the Pinacoteca is undoubtedly the one that can be seen from the balcony of the Pinacoteca itself: it is indeed a marvellous painting, a painting by Michelangelo. The architect Luca Beltrami was also responsible for the long thought-out and meditated distribution of the spaces according to the delicate, multiple needs of the precious artistic furnishings that were to populate it. He drew the construction lines; the choice and wise distribution of the building materials and decorative elements; the prediction and fixing of the mass in the difficult proportions and in the even more difficult harmonisation of it and its great lines with a length of 120 metres, with such a difference in levels, with the surrounding garden and with the nearby buildings and the connection of these to the new ones through the very elegant portico. The intelligence, skill and diligence of the builder, his extensive machinery and even more so the intelligent, skilled and willing assistants and workers, had to contribute and contributed greatly to the execution of such an important, beautiful and difficult work. But all this did not diminish the daily presence of the architect, nor his attentive care for the grandiose whole and the smallest details. We must add his noble selflessness and his moving devotion to the Holy See and to Our Person, a devotion that grew out of the solid and ancient trunk of a long friendship. Having prepared the house, there still remained one operation that was just as delicate as it was important: the transport and well-distributed placement of the inhabitants, for whom the house was built. The General Direction of the Vatican Museums and the special Direction of the Paintings provided for this with all the most meticulous care that such famous but at the same time often so ancient and fragile art relics required, skilfully reconciling with the competence that distinguishes them the reasons of time and school with those of place and aesthetic effect. We have fixed the historical event that adjoins us in the annual medal, which is usually reserved for the most remarkable event of the current year of the pontificate. We have also decided to mint a few very few copies in a larger format, which allows a more distinct view of the main building and the adjacent ones, and also bears the name of the architect. Let this also be a new demonstration of the full satisfaction of the architect.","pope":"Pius XI","type":"Speech","year":1932}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610d998b0a910b526c92c85e"},"text":"Venerable Brothers. Whenever, in the course of the year, Our Apostolic Office gives Us the opportunity to bring together your most illustrious assembly, We feel great satisfaction. Today the meeting is even more pleasing to Us inasmuch as we can together with you turn Our thoughts to the teachings and mysteries of the quadragesimal season, and already greet with a joyful spirit the joys of Easter. Having mentioned this first and most holy matter, it is only right to inform you, Venerable Brethren, of the very happy result achieved by Our Encyclical Maximam gravissimamque, which, on the very day sacred to the Chair of Peter in Rome, We addressed to the Bishops, the clergy and the people of France, announcing that the very difficult question of the Diocesan Associations was finally concluded, in the sense that We authorised and advised them to carry out the experiment. We say \"happy result\" because, in fact, all the decisions taken in this regard after long reflection have obtained the adhesion of the French people, who have publicly testified to us their gratitude. But, in truth, a spectacle beyond all praise, which brought us incredible joy and caused profound admiration throughout the Catholic world, was the example of deference and singular deference to the Apostolic See and the Vicar of Jesus Christ offered once again by the French Church. This is borne lasting witness not only by the collective pastoral letter which all the Bishops of France, without exception, addressed to the clergy and faithful on the 6th of last month, but also by the letters full of respect which they sent to us individually. Nor did this happen against Our hope and Our expectation; it was what the conduct of the French Church promised Us, witnessed in not dissimilar situations under the pontificates of Pius VII and Pius X. But, although we foresaw this testimony of filial piety, Our joy was no less and We like to publicly manifest the gratitude of Our soul to the Bishops, the clergy and the people of France in this solemn assembly to which - as We know - the faces and eyes of the whole world are turned. In the meantime, We have been asked how the Diocesan Associations should act in order to achieve the objective more easily and more conveniently, and We have indicated this by assuring them that We are ready to involve Our authority whenever necessary; but We leave to the initiative of the Bishops - as is right - the main questions relating to this matter, according to the different local circumstances and needs. Another spectacle, the theatre of which was not only France but the whole world, has come to bear witness to the faith of all Catholics and has filled Our heart with much sweetness. We are speaking of the second anniversary of Our accession to the Pontificate, which was remembered by all peoples with special devotion, and of the feast celebrated in the various parts of the world, which is amiably called \"the day of the Pope\": not only the masses of the people took part in these solemnities, but also the most notable citizens and even the highest public authorities, who in various ways bore witness to their attachment to Us. For all this and for so many tributes we thank the goodness of God and the affection of mankind, knowing that these honours and praises are not so much directed towards Our meagreness as towards the Prince of Shepherds, whose vicar God has appointed Us, despite Our few merits, to exercise His powers on earth. These facts are consoling and connected with the dignity and interests of Catholicism; but to them, Venerable Brethren, must be added others which cause us great pity and move us. To put it briefly, we do not forget those religious and priests who, under the leadership of John Baptist Cieplak, Archbishop of Achrida, were deprived of their liberty and still suffer the sufferings and tribulations of public imprisonment. Since it is impossible to help them in any other way, We remember these dear children before your College: they have so much right to our admiration and comfort, also because their imprisonment is prolonged. We desire that all good people do not forget their condition, and we do not cease to recommend them to those who hold them and with whom We seem to have some special opportunity to intervene. On the other hand, the number of those who, desirous of truth and charity, thirsting for unity and peace, are turning from schism and heresy towards Us and this Apostolic See, like stray sheep without a shepherd who aspire to the fold of the Lord, is considerable. It is hardly necessary to say how warmly we would like to embrace them, renewing the invitation of the supreme and only one of our brethren.","pope":"Pius XI","type":"Speech","year":1924}

We do not hide the fact that if the sadly notorious verses that vilified the sacred papal dignity were a cause of sorrow for us, we were much more hurt by the thought that the insult came from that dear Bologna, for which we preserve not only the memory, but also the feelings of the most tender affection. In truth, it is easy for us to distinguish the genuine lineage of Zama and Petronius from those who could never boast of being true sons of this noble city, whose honoured traditions have always been the light of learning and the source of civilisation.

With great satisfaction we have learned from your letter that eminent men have had the thought of forming a national committee in France for the preservation or defence of the French protectorate in the Holy Land. No undertaking could better respond to the generous and chivalrous traditions of your noble homeland, which was par excellence the land of the Crusaders. Many centuries have passed since then, many assaults have been made on the Church to weaken the faith. But the cult of the Holy Places has been maintained throughout the ages. If, at certain intervals, it has seemed to be somewhat weakened, we see it now reaffirmed with vigour in those peaceful pilgrimages of Christian piety, which We have been pleased to encourage again and again. Similarly, we cannot but highly praise the work now happily inaugurated, new in form, old in spirit, which seems to us to respond to the most urgent needs of the day. No one is unaware, in fact, that you, Our Dearest Son, have seen and touched with your own hand how much suffering and what dangers surround Catholic interests in Palestine. These interests, as everyone knows, are particularly connected with the ownership and use of the Sanctuaries built by the piety of our fathers, where the mysteries of the Redemption of mankind were worked out. The enemies of the Catholic name are redoubling their activity and efforts to jam the piety of the faithful children of the Holy Church in the shrines themselves. The work of which you speak to us, dearest Son, arises, therefore, at a propitious hour, and We hope for the most fruitful results in the future. France has a special mission in the East, entrusted to her by divine Providence; a noble mission, consecrated not only by secular practice, but also by international treaties, as Our Congregation of the Propaganda has recognised in these days with its declaration of 22 May 1898. The Holy See, in fact, does not want to touch anything of the glorious patrimony that France has received from her ancestors, and which she undoubtedly intends to deserve to preserve, by always showing herself to be equal to her mission. We desire, therefore, that the members of the Association already formed, fully inspired by these lofty thoughts, and having at heart the great interests of religion and country, should lend France a generous contribution in the fulfilment of its sixfold secular mandate. May these united efforts assure the Catholic Church in the East a peaceful existence, and enable her to work successfully for the propagation of the true faith and the return of the lost sheep to the fold of the Supreme and Only Shepherd.

{"_id":{"$oid":"610d9aec0a910b526c92c862"},"text":"Pope Leo XIII. To perpetual memory. It is inherent in nature and proven by the Catholic Church that men seek protection from those who are distinguished for holiness, and they also seek examples to imitate from those who attain perfection in some discipline; therefore, not a few Religious Orders, Lyceums, and persons of learning, with the approval of the Apostolic See, wished for some time to have as their teacher and patron Saint Thomas Aquinas, who always shone like a sun for doctrine and virtue. Indeed, in our own time the study of his doctrines has expanded and many have asked that in all high schools, academies and Catholic schools he be assigned as a patron by decree of this Apostolic See. Many Bishops also expressed the same desire in personal and collective letters; likewise, the members of many Academies and Associations of culture insisted on the same request with supplicating humility. And since it seemed opportune to postpone the acceptance of the ardent prayers of all of them, so that they might be consolidated with the passage of time, the propitious occasion arrived with Our Encyclical Letter \"De philosophia christiana ad mentem S. Thomae Aquinatis Doctoris Angelici in scholis catholicis instauranda\" which We published last year on this same day. Therefore, the bishops, the Academies, the learned counsellors of the Lyceums, and the scholars of the noble arts scattered throughout the earth, have confirmed their willingness to listen to Our word and to be, now and in the future, almost unanimous in their consent. Indeed, they have expressed a willingness to follow the footsteps of St. Thomas to the utmost in teaching the philosophical and theological disciplines, affirming, not unlike Us, that they identify in the Thomistic doctrines an evident superiority and a singular vigorous aptitude for healing the evils by which our age is afflicted. Therefore We, who have long and earnestly desired to see all schools of learning flourish under the protection of a master so eminent in faith and patronage, since the desires common to all are so clear and declared, think the time has come to decide that the immortal glory of Thomas Aquinas should be increased by the concurrence of this new title of merit. This is the main reason that urges us: let Catholics understand that Saint Thomas excels among all, as an example of a scholar of various disciplines. And indeed in him are present all the brightest gifts of mind and intellect, for which he rightly calls others to imitate him: fruitful, uncorrupted, wisely structured doctrine; respect for the faith and an admirable concordance with the truths of divine origin; integrity of life together with the splendour of the most excellent virtues. His doctrine is so great that it encompasses, like a sea, all the wisdom derived from the ancients. All that has been said or wisely discussed by the pagan philosophers, by the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, by the great men who distinguished themselves before him, has not only been assimilated by him, but has been increased, brought to completion, and ordered with such luminous perspicuity of form, with such careful argumentation, and with such propriety of language, that he left to posterity the faculty of imitating him, but seems to have taken away from them the ability to surpass him. His greatness consists in the fact that his doctrine, structured and unfolded according to perfectly evident principles, is not only adequate to the needs of a single epoch but of all times, and above all capable of refuting the errors that reappear with perennial vicissitude. That doctrine, by confirming itself with its own rational vigour, remains unconquered and inspires profound dismay in its adversaries. And it is no less to be appreciated, especially in the judgment of Christians, the perfect coincidence of reason and faith. In fact, the Holy Doctor clearly demonstrates that everything that is true in nature cannot be in contradiction with what is believed to be the work of God; therefore, following and honouring the Christian faith is not a sign of humble servitude without reason, but a noble homage that benefits the mind and educates it to more sublime thoughts. Finally, he demonstrates that intelligence and faith both proceed from God, not for the purpose of fostering competition between them, but to protect each other by the bond of friendship connected with mutual duties. The reflection of their harmony and their admirable concord can be seen in all the writings of Blessed Thomas. For in his writings there stands out and excels at times the intellect, which in the investigation of nature achieves what it wants, provided that it puts faith first; at times faith, which with the help of reason enlightens and protects itself in such a way as to preserve its own strength and dignity intact; moreover, in case of necessity, both make a pact with each other to defeat common enemies. And if the lasting and firm harmony between reason and faith has always been of the utmost importance, it is even more so in the future. ","pope":"Leo XIII","type":"Brief","year":1880}

With the more assiduous zeal We have striven to raise the afflicted fortunes of the Church of the Armenians and to bring it back to that order, harmony and stability which could restore it to its former dignity, the more bitterly We are troubled by the malice of some who not only make all Our cares vain, but by their intrigues lacerate consciences, scandalize the timid, and succeed in harming their own people. The ever-increasing evils caused by their wiles were recorded in Our Apostolic Letter Non sine gravissimo which We published on the 24th of February this year, and in the meantime, in order to suppress and crush them, We sent to you the Venerable Brother Antonio Giuseppe Archbishop of Tiane as Our Apostolic Delegate. Indeed, today we are afflicted with an even deeper sorrow, because his gentleness, his prudence, his authority have not been able in any way to break or mitigate the audacity of the perverts. He himself, as soon as he arrived at Constantinople, mindful of ecclesiastical gentleness, summoned to himself the most important promoters of the sedition, and tried with fatherly admonitions to bring them to due obedience. Since he had used this device in vain, he presented in public Our Letter in which (mentioning also the extraordinary character of the most recent events) We praised his zeal, confirmed Our constitution Reversurus published on the 12th July 1867 in favour of a correct election of Bishops, tried to recall the secular clergy to the duties of their ministry and admonished the Monks and the Laity not to go beyond the limits fixed for them by the Church; We also clearly demonstrated the emptiness of the requests made by the refractors. On that occasion, the Venerable Brother Anthony Joseph himself threatened ecclesiastical censure to those clergy who refused to submit to legitimate authority within the prescribed days. But then, seeing that these days had passed in vain, he decided to extend the time limit still further, and did not strike the recalcitrants with suspension until he had realised that patience was entirely useless and that it was necessary to prevent by severity the danger of further deception at the expense of the simple people. However, those who had been punished in this way not only did not retreat from their obstinacy, but converted the same punishment into a more heinous crime and a greater scandal for others: they impudently despised the authority and laws of the Church, and continued to publicly practice all the duties of the sacred ministry forbidden to them, even in an even more solemn rite. Above all, we regret that some secular priests who live among the Monks of Constantinople, almost all of whom are Mekhitarists of the Venetian Congregation, and all of the Antonian Monks, have committed this crime, and we regret that those who live in this city of ours have not dissented from this decision. These, in fact, not only opposed the Apostolic visitation in their house recommended by Us (like their brothers in the East), and several times rejected the first and second Visitator elected, but all, without asking permission, evaded Us. Among them, also the Venerable Brother Placidus Kasagian who (consecrated with the title of the Church of Antioch, had governed the whole Congregation), unaware of his duty and of the censures imposed on the Bishops who had deserted the Council without imploring pontifical authorization, turned away in turn. Indeed, the obstinacy of the rebels and the cunning used to stir up the souls make more precious and gratifying for Us the firmness of the very many who were induced neither by snares, nor by flattery, nor by threats to abandon the obedience due to Our legitimate authority. Among these, we deem it our duty to praise by name the Mekhitarists of the Viennese Congregation who, unmoved by the deplorable defection of others, remained steadfast in their duty. Indeed, such devout perseverance at such a grave moment gives us the reasonable hope that you, Beloved Sons, having removed all human respect, will strictly follow the noble traces of your fathers who, putting their faith before these defections, bravely endured exile and every adversity rather than loosen their bonds of solidarity with this centre of Catholic unity, or fail in their veneration for which the documents indicated the rules proposed by your school of truth.

Venerable Brothers, health and Apostolic Blessing. Venerable Brothers, lift up your eyes and you will see, and together with Us you will feel great sorrow for the terrible abominations by which this wretched Italy is especially afflicted today. We truly humbly adore the inscrutable judgments of God, who pleased to make us live in these most unhappy times in which, by the work of some men, and particularly of those who in the most unhappy Italy rule and govern the public thing, the commandments of God and the laws of the Holy Church are entirely trampled upon, and impiety raises its head higher with impunity and triumphs. Hence originate all the iniquities, evils and damages that we see with great pain of Our soul. Hence those multitudinous phalanxes that walk in ungodliness, militating under the banner of Satan, on which lies are written, and who, inspiring rebellion, and speaking against heaven, blaspheme God, defile and despise every sacred thing, and, violating every divine and human right, like ravening wolves yearn for prey, They shed blood and lose souls by their most grievous scandals, and they seek in the most unrighteous ways to gain by their malice; they violently kidnap others, they displease the poor and weak, they increase the number of poor widows and babes, and, accepting gifts, they forgive the wicked, while they deny justice to the righteous man and strip him; corrupt in heart, they endeavour to satisfy all their foul passions in a foul manner, to the greatest detriment of civil society itself. Today we are surrounded by this race of wicked men, Venerable Brothers. These men, animated by a truly diabolical spirit, wish to place the banner of lies in this, Our beloved city, next to the Chair of Peter, which is the centre of truth and Catholic unity. The rulers of the Piedmontese government, who are supposed to restrain such men, do not hesitate to favour them in every way, to provide them with arms and all things, and to make it safe for them to enter this city. But let all these men, though they are constituted in the supreme rank and place of civil power, tremble, because by this truly iniquitous way of proceeding they bring upon themselves new ecclesiastical penalties and censures. Although in the humility of Our heart We do not cease to pray earnestly and to implore God, who is rich in mercy, to deign to call all these most wretched men back to a salutary penance on the right path of justice, religion and piety, We cannot, however, conceal the very grave dangers to which we are exposed in this hour of darkness. We await events with a truly tranquil spirit, whatever they may be, even if they are aroused by nefarious frauds, slanders, snares and lies, having placed all Our hope in God, Our health, Who is Our help and strength in all Our tribulations. He does not allow those who hope in Him to be confused, and He scatters the snares of the wicked and breaks the necks of sinners. In the meantime, we cannot help but denounce to you above all, Venerable Brothers, and to all the faithful entrusted to your care, the very sad condition and the very grave dangers in which we find ourselves due especially to the work of the Piedmontese government. In fact, although we are defended by the valour and devotion of Our most faithful army, which in glorious deeds gave proofs of almost heroic valour, it is nevertheless clear that it cannot resist for long against the much greater number of unjust aggressors. Although Our consolation is not small in the filial piety towards Us of Our subjects, who have been reduced to a few by the wicked usurpers, we are nevertheless obliged to feel great sorrow, while they cannot but feel the grave dangers that hang over them on account of the ferocious bands of unjust men, who continually dispossess them with all sorts of threats and torment them in every way. But we have to complain of other evils that have never been deplored enough, Venerable Brothers. Especially from Our Address in the Consistory of 29 October last year, and then from the exposition, accompanied by documents and printed matter, you have learned very well how many misfortunes the Catholic Church and her children in the Russian Empire and in the Kingdom of Poland are miserably harassed and torn apart. Indeed, Catholic bishops, clergymen and lay faithful are being driven into exile, imprisoned, tormented in every way, stripped of their possessions, troubled and oppressed by the severest punishments; the canons and laws of the Church are being trampled underfoot.

Venerable Brothers, Health and Apostolic Blessing. Our hearts rejoice in the Lord, Venerable Brethren, and we have given the most humble and great thanks to the most clement Father of all mercies and to the God of all consolation because, amidst the assiduous and most grievous anguish by which we are oppressed in this and this great evil of times, we have received news from many of your witnesses concerning the happy and abundant fruits of the Sacred Jubilee granted by Us: fruits which, with the favour of divine Grace, re-flowered the peoples entrusted to your care. For you have informed us that on this occasion the faithful peoples of your dioceses flocked to the sacred temples with great frequency and in the spirit of humility and with a contrite soul, to attend the preaching of the Word of God and to enter the Divine Table after having purified their souls from the filth of sin by means of the Sacrament of Reconciliation; at the same time they raised fervent prayers to the Most High God according to Our intentions. It has thus happened that not a few, with the help of Divine Grace, have, from their vicious conduct, embarked upon a salutary path of life by following the paths of truth. All this news brought us great consolation and joy, since we are very anxious and solicitous for the salvation of all men entrusted to Us by God, nothing more ardently do we desire and ask God with all our vows and prayers day and night in the humility of Our heart, that all peoples, nations and nations, walking more and more each day in the ways of faith, may come to recognize Him and love Him, and fulfil His most holy law and persevere in the way that leads to life. Although, Venerable Brethren, on the one hand we must greatly rejoice that the people of your dioceses have received great spiritual benefits from the sacred Jubilee, on the other hand we must grieve not a little when we see what a mournful and distressing aspect our most holy religion and civil society present in these most miserable times. For none among you, Venerable Brethren, know with what devious devices, with what monstrous instruments of opinion, with what nefarious machinations the enemies of God and of mankind seek to pervert the minds of all, and endeavour to corrupt morals, in order, if it were possible for them, to destroy religion everywhere and to undo the bonds of civil society and destroy it from the foundations. Hence we must deplore a caligin of errors spread over the minds of many; a bitter war against all Catholicism and against this Apostolic See; a terrible hatred of virtue and honesty; the worst vices considered honest by a lying name; an unrestrained license to all opinion, to live and to all dare; an intolerant intolerance of any authority, power or command; The contempt and mockery of all holy things, the holiest laws, and the best institutions; a miserable corruption of improvident youth; a pestiferous collusion of bad books, flying pamphlets, and newspapers and magazines that teach sin; the deadly poison of unbelief and indifference; the motions of impious conspiracies; and every right, both human and divine, despised and mocked. And it is not unknown to you, Venerable Brethren, what anxieties, what doubts, what hesitations and what fears urge and consequently distress the minds of all, especially those of the well-thinking, for the worst evils are to be feared for public and private morals when men, wretchedly departing from the norms of justice, truth and religion, and serving the wicked and untamed passions, plot in their hearts any wickedness. In such a grievous circumstance everyone can see that all our hopes must be placed in God, our salvation, and that fervent and continual prayers must be addressed to Him, so that, pouring out upon all peoples the riches of His mercy and enlightening the minds of all with the light of His heavenly grace, He deigns to lead the erring back to the path of righteousness and to convert to Himself the rebellious wills of His enemies, infusing in all the love and fear of His Holy Name, and giving the spirit to think and act always seeking all that is good, all that is true, all that is modest, all that is just and holy. And since the Lord is gentle, meek, merciful and generous towards all who call upon Him, He looks kindly on the prayer of the humble and manifests His omnipotence especially by forgiving and using mercy, let us go, O Venerable Brothers, with confidence to the throne of Grace to obtain mercy and find grace in the appropriate help.

To the enormous worries that in this great harshness of the times make heavier the duties of the apostolic service, entrusted to Our weakness by divine will, has been added that, truly most serious, caused by the recent decree of this Grand Duchy of Etruria. From the same government of the Grand Duchy we have in fact learned that a certain law, already abolished, has again been reinstated, by which all the printers of the Duchy are forbidden with the utmost severity to publish any writing of the sacred prelates, without having first submitted it to the examination of the lay magistrate. No words are sufficient, Venerable Brother, to express how bitter and deep was the pain of Our soul as soon as We learned that this law had again been adopted, by which a most serious wound is done to the liberty of the Church, and to the honour, authority and jurisdiction of the Bishops, who are forced to depend on the will and decision of a lay magistrate in matters concerning religion and the salvation of souls. Although for the present we have not deemed it opportune to complain by Our complaint against this law, considering seriously that, besides this single law, there are in force many other norms of this government which, likewise, oppose ecclesiastical liberty and the sacred rights of religion, and recalling what was done in the past because of a similar law; nevertheless, we shall not only keep this and other matters of great importance always in mind, but in truth, trusting in divine help in favour of the most high office of Our Pontificate, we shall never leave any stone unturned in what we judge most suitable to protect the rights of this Apostolic See and of the Bishops in the religious affairs of the Grand Duchy of Etruria. In the meantime, Venerable Brother, with regard to the impaired faculty of printing the various Episcopal acts, which we are dealing with, we deem it our duty to offer you and the other Ordinaries of the Grand Duchy of Etruria the same suggestions and warnings that Our Predecessor Pius VII, of recent memory, deemed it his duty to send in writing to your Predecessor Pietro Francesco Morali, on 10 October 1818. Thus, even if we praise the way of acting recently undertaken, as far as we are aware, by your fraternity and by other Bishops, that is to say, to divulge the acts by writing them by hand, and we strongly hope that all religious leaders will commit themselves to the same behaviour as far as possible; nevertheless we declare that it is Our determination to tolerate that the Ordinaries have recourse to the printing presses, if they consider it necessary, in urgent cases, but consider themselves as purely passive as far as the constraints imposed by the government are concerned. Following in the footsteps of Our Predecessor Pius VII, We earnestly exhort the Ordinaries that - mindful of the ministry they received in the Lord - they may never cease to protect and defend with all their might the authority and integrity of the Church and Her most holy rights, even in the name of this Apostolic See, even by means of insistent petitions addressed, in due time and with due deference, to the Grand Duke of Etruria. We know very well that the protests and petitions previously made by them in this matter have not had the slightest effect, but in truth we must never lose heart, since at the time of Pius VII a matter of this kind was subject to the greatest difficulties. As a matter of fact, that very famous Predecessor of ours had not been able to influence Ferdinand, at that time Grand Duke of Etruria, with his very wise and cordial letters; the hopes conceived for a form of explanation (which seemed to be given by the government of Etruria in his last letter, dated 23rd January 1818) remained unsatisfied because of another letter that the person in charge of the good regime wrote to all the governors of the provinces, on 17th July of the same year. Nevertheless, the Bishops of Etruria, urged on by Pius VII's letter and animated by their prudent constancy, obtained the right to freely arrange for the printed publication of all episcopal documents, without the constraint of any examination, with the sole exception of the solemn pastoral letters, which they rarely used to publish. In truth, Venerable Brother, in this and the other tasks of the sacred ministry, the pastors of the Church cannot absolutely know how and when God, who is rich in mercy, will crown their labours and their concerns with a happy outcome, but they themselves, as you know very well, would commit the gravest of sins if they were to omit for this reason to correspond to the divine aids, which sacred pastors do not lack in order to carry out their tasks.","pope":"Gregory XVI","type":"Epistola","year":1845}

The valiant arms that We invoked from the ever pious and august Austrian monarch Francis I to bring back among you that tranquillity, order and calm, which the past disturbances had carried away, are now withdrawn from these provinces in the certainty that the misled, finally disenchanted, will also rejoin those who form the majority of these populations, and all, in agreement, treading the paths that the Religion of their fathers, the duties of subjection, the stimulus of honour have marked out, will all concur indistinctly and effectively to achieve those prosperities that only a sound morality can procure and that civil concord and a true love of peace can consolidate. You saw these victorious arms, as they were able to give you proofs of valour no less than of exemplary moderation. They came among you as friends, and have constantly shown themselves to be such. They came to relieve the oppressed and to contain the oppressors, and they have not for one moment failed in their generous mission. They have fully complied both with the pressing need of those who called them to restrain the impetus of a furious storm, and with the august orders of their lord, who cared for nothing more than bringing the children back to their father, restoring peace to the dominions of the common mother, the Holy Roman Church. In short, they withdraw from Our States with the certainty of having spared you the gravest evils, and with the well-founded flattery that you are now able to prevent the most disastrous return. It is for this purpose that we do not wish at this time to remain silent, and not to open Our heart to you again. Strong in the sacred rights of this Holy See, as well as in the solemn and not unknown to you guarantees given to us at this meeting by the high powers of Europe, we should speak to you more as a Sovereign than as a Father; but we reserve the language of a Sovereign to circumstances in which new disorders may be attempted, and new deviations may arise to disturb public or private tranquillity: and we wish, for the moment, that Our children return to listen only to the voices of a Father. We were grieved, and greatly grieved by the very sad events of the past, and God knows, Most Excellent Maximus, if, more than the pain we suffered, Our heart was torn at the idea of one day being forced to use the sword of justice. And since He Himself, as we hope, has opened to Us the path of mercies, with true jubilation of Our soul We wish to announce to You ourselves that We desire nothing more than to be able to forget the past. Let each one of you know, and we repeat this with an outpouring of paternal tenderness, that he who has demeritted Our grace among you may recover it if he gives unquestionable proof of his repentance. May mutual but true and permanent love bring you all together, and may they all form one family, and may the Almighty see to it that from now on there is no other distinction among you than that resulting from the higher grades of virtue, fidelity and obedience. May each of you aspire to this, and may your homelands boast of it, that they may count it to their glory, and as a result have true and lasting tranquillity before Religion and society. Strengthened by such a beautiful hope, We shall strive tirelessly for your good. In the midst of the afflictions and anxieties that have given us such bitterness since we assumed the Pontificate, this has still been an object of Our solicitude, and you have seen it in effect. It will become especially dear to Us, if We do not have to combat new and inauspicious disturbances, and with them the many disasters that would be their inevitable consequence. It is in these sentiments that We have confidently extended Our heart to you, and that We implore upon all of you from the Father of consolations the fullness of true happiness with the Apostolic Blessing.","pope":"Gregory XVI","type":"Epistola","year":1831}

It is not only sweet and agreeable to Us to express to you Our intimate sentiments of benevolence, but above all, for the supreme good of the Christian life, It benefits Us to enter into spiritual communion with you, and together to know what greater benefits, day by day, can be procured for the Church. This is a task of Our ministry, entrusted to Us in the person of St. Peter by the divine commission of the Founder of the Church Himself; for it is Our task to shepherd, guide, and govern not only the lambs, that is, the Christian people, but also the sheep, that is, the Bishops. We rejoice with all our hearts and we thank the Prince of Shepherds for having appointed such shepherds to watch over his flock, animated solely by the concern and the thought of leading it along the paths of justice, of keeping every danger away from it, of not losing any of those whom the Father has entrusted to them. In fact, Venerable Brothers, we are well aware of your firm faith, assiduous zeal for Religion, admirable holiness of life and singular prudence. We therefore expect many reasons of joy for Us, for the Church, for this Holy See from such a crown of irreproachable workers; this happy hope inspires courage in Us, fearful as We are under the weight of such a task, and it restores and recreates Us, even though We are overwhelmed by so many anxieties. But lest we should unreasonably urge on those who are already in a hurry, we shall willingly omit to entertain you at length about the duties which must be borne in mind in the exercise of your ministry, according to what the sacred canons prescribe; there is no need to remind you that no one must abandon the place and the custody of the flock entrusted to him, and with what care and diligence the choice of sacred ministers must be approached. Rather, we address Our prayers to God the Saviour, that He may protect you by the power of His grace and bring your actions and efforts to a successful conclusion. In spite of this, although the Lord comforts us by your courage, Venerable Brothers, we are compelled to be still sad, feeling the cruel bitterness which, even in a situation of peace, the children of this century inflict upon us. Let us speak, O Brothers, of those known and manifest evils which we deplore with common tears, and which with united effort we must correct, extirpate and defeat. Let us speak of the innumerable errors, of the perverse doctrines that fight against the Catholic faith, no longer secretly and surreptitiously, but with open fury. You know how wicked men have raised warlike insignia against Religion, resorting to philosophy, of which they proclaim themselves doctors, and to fatuous sophistry drawn from worldly ideas. This Roman Holy See of the most blessed Peter, on which Christ laid the foundation of His Church, is especially persecuted; little by little the bonds of its unity are broken. The authority of the Church is undermined, the sacred ministers are isolated and despised. The most virtuous precepts are rejected, the divine rites are mocked, the worship of God is execrated by the sinner (Sir 1:32); all that concerns Religion is considered as an old fable and as vain superstition. We say with tears: \"Truly the lions roared over Israel (Jer 2:25); truly they gathered against God and against Christ; truly the wicked cried out: destroy Jerusalem, destroy it to the foundations\" (Ps 137:7). This is the aim of the foul conspiracy of the sophists of this century, who do not admit any distinction between the different professions of faith; who believe that the harbour of eternal health is open to all, whatever their religious confession, and who brand those who abandon the religion in which they were brought up to embrace another, even the Catholic religion, as fatuous and foolish. Certainly it is a hideous marvel of impiety to attribute the same praise to truth and error, to virtue and vice, to honesty and turpitude.","pope":"Pius VIII","type":"Encyclical","year":1829}

Although we are convinced that the letter [encyclical] which, on the occasion of the elevation of Our humility to the Chair of Saint Peter, We sent to all the Bishops of the Catholic world, has already long since reached your hands, so great is the fire of charity in which We burn for you and for your flock that We have determined, in order to manifest Our spirit to you, to address ourselves especially to you. In truth, with the bitterest and most incredible pain, which arises from the paternal affection with which we love you, we have received the saddest news about the deplorable situation of the State and the disarray of ecclesiastical affairs, because of the discord that an enemy man has sown there. For we are well aware of the prejudices that are caused to Religion when it happens that the tranquility of the people is unfortunately altered. For this reason we complain bitterly that the licentiousness of the wicked is manifested with impunity; that there is a growing plague of books in which the ecclesiastical and civil powers are despised and hated; and finally, that there arise, like locusts from the smoke of a well, those obscure aggregations of which, with Saint Leo, we dare to say that all that is blasphemous and sacrilegious in heretical sects is gathered together, as well as all kinds of filth in an unclean bilge. This unquestionable truth, worthy of the greatest commiseration from the experience of those calamities that have tormented us with the violent upheavals of the past, and proved by so many examples, causes us a fierce bitterness, because we realize that this kind of disorder threatens enormous evils to this land of the Lord. In examining these things with sorrow, We extend Our heart to you, Venerable Brethren, thinking that you will be intimately animated by the same solicitude for the very grave danger which overtakes your flock. Called to the sacred ministry by the One who came to bring peace on earth and who was its author and perfecter, you know that your principal obligation is to ensure that Religion is preserved intact, which clearly depends on the tranquility of the homeland. And since the bond of Religion unites in the same duty those who command and those who obey, it is broken down when, as discord, dissension and disturbance of public order increase, brother strikes out against brother and house collapses upon house. We therefore exhort your faithfulness, Venerable Brethren, and wish your daily solicitude to be stimulated by this Our incitement, which with God's help will not be useless to the lazy nor burdensome to the devout. Let it not happen, beloved ones, that when God sifts the sins of the peoples with the blows of His indignation, you withhold your words, lest the faithful entrusted to your care should think that the voices of exultation and salvation are heard only in the seats of the righteous; then shall those be in the fullness and beauty of peace who are in the paths of the envoys of the Lord, who determines concord among princes and places kings on the throne. The ancient and holy Religion, in which one is saved, can in no way be preserved in purity and integrity when the kingdom is divided into factions, is miserably desolate, as the Lord Jesus Christ warns; and it will happen with absolute certainty that the inventors of novelties will be forced, in spite of themselves, to invoke the truth, together with the prophet Jeremiah: \"We have waited for peace, and have not received it; we have waited for the time of medicine, and behold, terror; we have waited for the time of health, and behold, turmoil. We are firmly persuaded that you, with God's help, will be able to carry out this burdensome task successfully, if you illustrate to your flock the august and distinguished virtues of Our dearest son in Christ Ferdinand, Catholic King of Spain, to whom nothing is dearer than Religion and the happiness of his subjects; and if, with the necessary zeal, you will place before the eyes of all the illustrious and immortal examples of the Spaniards resident in Europe, who did not hesitate to sacrifice their fortunes and their lives in order to show themselves always most faithful to Religion and to the legitimate power. We have written these things, Venerable Brethren, with that ardent affection for you and your flock, which is all the more intense when you are oppressed by very grave circumstances, in the enormous distance which separates you from your common Father. It is your duty to help the afflicted people, to remove from the minds of all the worries (the thought of which stirs up weeping), and to pray assiduously and humbly for them, as befits one who loves his brethren and his people, that God may calm the winds of discord and restore tranquillity.

Two months have already passed, and they are not without worries or commitments, since God imposed on Our frailty this very heavy burden of placing Us at the head of His whole Church. Not so much because of the custom that has been established since the earliest times, as because of the love that we bear you and which began in the past for reasons of connection and which we now feel admirably increased and enlarged, We must speak to you at least by letter; and nothing can be more pleasing and consoling to us.

However, who is so foolish and animated by a spirit so adverse to Us that he does not understand and see even the things that can be seen at first sight, namely that Christ, even in these difficult and adverse circumstances, has always been present, since He had promised to \"pray for Peter, that his faith might not fail\"?

For when he was cruelly driven out of his city and his See, stripped of all power, honour and fortune, forced to move elsewhere as soon as he seemed to have found a quiet place, dragged to distant lands, although he was old and sick so as to be unable to make the journey on foot, and moreover overtaken by the terror of a more cruel exile, he would not have had enough to feed himself and the few who had followed him if someone compassionate and generous had not helped him. Though sickness and loneliness tempted him daily, he never failed in himself, was not deceived by any fraud, nor troubled by any fear, nor flattered by any hope, nor shaken by any hardship or danger; His enemies were not able to wrest from him a letter or a word that did not testify to all that Peter \"lived up to this time in his successors and did justice; which no one doubts and which is more than known to all from the earliest times\" as a very authoritative author said at the Council of Ephesus (Acts 3). Is it to be held in high esteem, and remembered with a grateful heart, that Pius VI was granted death by God (one must in fact say so, rather than speaking of a life taken) when there was nothing to prevent his successor being elected according to the rite? Remember, Venerable Brethren, how fearful and anxious we were when the very Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, driven from their seats, imprisoned in great numbers, some led to death, a great many forced to cross the sea in full storm, stripped of their possessions, all made poor, most separated from each other by great distances, with the roads occupied by the enemy, unable to correspond with each other by letter, or to go where they wished and where it would have been opportune: everything led to the belief that in no way would they be able to come together to provide for a Church without a Head according to the ancient customs and rules, if by chance Pius VI, who was said to be in danger of his life every day, should succumb. Well, in the midst of these afflictions and in an almost desperate situation, who could have foreseen, relying only on the counsels and resources of human wisdom, what would happen by a singular divine benevolence, that Pius VI would not leave this life before he himself had established the rules for the pontifical assemblies to be held after him, that almost the whole of Italy would be appeased, that the whole of Venetia would be reordered, that a great many Cardinals would be present in Venice to vote with the favour and protection of Our dearest son in Christ Francis, Apostolic King of Hungary, illustrious King of Bohemia and elected Emperor of the Romans?","pope":"Pius VII","type":"Encyclical","year":1800}

Venerable Brothers and beloved sons, health and Apostolic Blessing. 1. The crimes perpetrated against the laws of the sanctuary both in Avignon and in the Venetian county of Our jurisdiction, and against the rights of sovereignty, are so well known and widespread among the nations that they need no long and detailed description. In fact, both peoples have sinned gravely against Us; but the defection of the Avignon people is far worse than that of the people of the county. For the Avignonese, not caring at all for having followed the wickedness of a few men who, through Our clemency, had escaped the punishments due for their crimes, as if they had wielded with their own hands the banner of rebellion, have so advanced in arrogance, that they induced the people of the county, even with an armed hand, to form with them a nefarious society and to force the people of the county and the Avignonese who opposed them to follow their party, persuading them with all kinds of threats, slaughter and torture. 2. But we shall not speak of this crime, as of others; but the respectable citizens and churchmen who were kidnapped to death, the city of Chalon sur Saône which was forcibly occupied and sacked, the hostile raids on the city of Carpentras, and other kinds of unrestrained violence, which will stain the wicked perpetrators with eternal ignominy and infamy, may be a very valid proof. For, imitating the cruelty of Jason, the enemy of the country's laws and of God, as his sacred writings testify, they did not spare their fellow-citizens from slaughter, in order to remove the citizens and those of the country from the laws of the country and of God; nor did they think that the prosperity gained against friends was the greatest of evils, as if they were capturing trophies of enemies, not of fellow-citizens: worthy therefore, not otherwise than as it was of Jason, to be declared odious to all, desecrators of the laws, and traitors to their country. 3. The cause and burden of these rebellions began to spread among the people, by which they were more and more oppressed. But when it became clear to everyone that the reason for all this was absolutely fictitious and full of slander, since the Avignonese and the people of the county, oppressed by no kind of taxation, enjoyed a regime so light and temperate that the other nations envied, not without reason, their happiness, it became evident that the only true cause was the desire for unbridled freedom: for the attainment of which it was declared to be necessary that the full Constitution of the French Assembly should be committed as much in political as in ecclesiastical and religious matters, and lead to a greater and more lasting happiness, and consequently the people of Avignon and the Country should come under French sovereignty. 4. In the midst of these wicked wickednesses we have not ceased to show to both peoples how great and how great is Our benevolence of father and sovereign towards the ungrateful. It was in fact Our care, not without considerable expense to the papal treasury, to free these peoples from the impending commitments with great charity; and We paternally admonished them to beware of the hidden snares, which were offered to them, to Religion and also to the public utility under the chimera of freedom. If, however, because of the variety of the times, or even because of human prevarication, some transgression against the laws had arisen, or some particular abuse had been introduced, We openly declared that We, having listened to the Communities, would have lent Our work and assistance so that everything might return, with due correction, to the right order. And in order that no one might doubt that in so far as it was in Our power We would intervene with Our authority, We immediately resolved to send there Our beloved son Giovanni Celestini, a man well known to many in Avignon, manager of affairs in the Venetian county, so that he might reach Avignon and Carpentras as soon as possible, and there, with Our delegate and with the most experienced and prudent citizens, to discuss those chapters, that is to say, those points that were especially desired to be known, so that with unanimous votes we could support the determination of those things that were judged convenient and opportune. Two letters from Us in the form of Briefs were expressed in this sense, one written on the 21st of April of last year to the beloved noble sons and people of Our city of Avignon, the other written on the 24th of February of the same year to Our Venerable Brother the Bishop of Carpentras, and to the beloved sons designated by the general councils of the same city.","pope":"Pius VI","type":"Encyclical","year":1791}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610da0120a910b526c92c86d"},"text":"Bishop Pio, servant of the servants of God. To all the Christian faithful who read this letter, health and Apostolic Blessing. 1. By God's great kindness to us, and by a singular grace, it happened that, reflecting on the great year of the Jubilee, and observing the sacred ceremonies minutely, we opened the sacred doors, and closed them on the day fixed by tradition. The first event occurred on 26 February, on the twelfth day on which, having come to the Chair of Peter, we occupied the highest office of the Pontificate: this holy and solemn office, by which the acceptable time of penance and the days of salvation had come to Christians and the treasures of divine mercy were opened. In the vicissitudes of human history and changing nature, it happened that, not without divine design, a delayed task was reserved for us. Having removed from the living Clement XIV of holy memory, Our predecessor, who had proclaimed the Jubilee in a pontifical letter distributed throughout the world and had established the regular opening of the sacred doors on the eve of the birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ, it was left to Our humility to intervene and accomplish that which He had begun and left unfinished. We therefore celebrated that most holy rite in the basilica of St Peter, Prince of the Apostles, not without a great concourse of people and with immense joy in our souls. For, just as with identical ceremonies in the basilicas of Saint Paul's, in the Lateran, and in that of Saint Mary Major, we appointed three of our brother cardinals of the Holy Roman Church to act in Our name and with Our authority, and appointed them legates a latere, so by concession of divine Providence, it came about that Our Pontificate began with the solemn fame of the Jubilee. 2. The same programme We ourselves observed when by divine providence We arrived at the Christmas of Our Saviour, the day established by ancient custom for closing the holy door, and the above-mentioned Cardinals performed the same rite, with the same title, in their own basilicas. And the conclusion also responded well to the most auspicious beginnings. 3. Blessed be the author, the moderator, the perfecter, the God of all goodness and of every honest will, who did not disdain to accomplish with us this great mercy of His; to the One and Triune God, glory, praise in the eternal memory of men: to Him who willed this at the beginning of Our pontificate as a sign of His benevolence, so that we might be placed in a condition of good hope for Christianity. 4. For the truth is, in Our greatest agitation, from which We are tormented day and night by the solicitude of all the Churches, although undeserving, We have felt that no small relief has been offered to Our fear, because, with the help of divine grace, so great a work has been accomplished, so salutary for Our city and for all Christendom. Not once did we exult in the Lord, and we were moved with tears of consolation when we saw the great streets of the city filled with the multitude of the faithful, who had but one thought: to acquire God's forgiveness in weeping and contrition. We rejoiced, when we saw that the religiousness of the citizens competed in mutual emulation with the piety of the foreigners; they, driven by Christian charity towards the guests, did not look at expenses, efforts, sacrifices, adaptations, to accommodate the foreigners, to refresh those who were prostrated by the fatigues of the journey, to raise them with every care. These men, showing a humility worthy of the Christian name, testified also by their dress and manner of conduct, how faith had called them from their homelands and had driven them to the tombs of the Holy Apostles. A burning fervour shone in them all when, according to the rite of supplication, they visited the holy monuments of the city, kissed the doorposts of the holy doors; when they walked the long stretches of road singing psalms, hymns and penitential invocations, so that it could truly be said and affirmed that they had not neglected the old penitential formula used in the early days of the Church. 5. Our soul was then filled with incredible joy and the greatest satisfaction came from the fact that the royal youth Maximilian, the Austrian, came to the holy city, and we were able to speak in person and embrace him in the Lord. His good nature gave no few examples of virtue during the time he was with Us, amidst the admiration of the foreigners and the applause of the citizens, especially when he wanted to enrich himself with the treasures of the Jubilee.

The inscrutable design of divine wisdom, whose works are always marvellous, just as, from among a thousand persons, it chose David of most humble origin, and from the flock of sheep it raised him to the throne of glory to govern his people and to make them acceptable to God with the rod of command; He likewise did not despise Our lowliness, so that, although We were the last of all to be admitted among the papal fathers and held the last place, yet He willed that We of all others, who appeared more worthy of the papal diadem, should assume the functions of Pontiff, and, raised to such great honour, should govern His whole Church. When, silent and grateful, we consider carefully this marvellous deigning, and the immense goodness towards Us, we cannot refrain from weeping, reflecting on this mercy so beneficent and at the same time on this omnipotence, by which He so generously poured out His gifts upon one in whom He found no merit: putting Us, weak and undeserving, at the head of the nations, so that, replacing the Eternal Shepherd on earth, We might shepherd His descendants of the faithful and guide them to the holy mountain of Zion in the Heavenly Jerusalem. And since it is absolutely agreed that Our homage and the offering of the consecrated Pontiff should begin with praise to the Lord, we cannot fail to burst into voices of exultation; trusting in the Lord, Our mouth should sing with the prophet (Ps 144:21) the praises of the Lord; and Our soul, spirit, flesh and tongue should bless His holy name: \"If it is a sign of devotion to rejoice in a gift, it is also necessary to be doubtful of one's own merit. For what is more fearful than toil imposed on those who are too weak, elevation on those who are too low, dignity conferred on those who do not deserve it?\" (St Leo M., Sermon I, Chapter 2). 2. Who would not be terrified at the present condition of the Christian people, in which divine charity, by which we are in God, and God in us, grows noticeably cold, and crimes and iniquities increase from day to day? Who would not be distressed at the very sad consideration that we have assumed the custody and protection of the Church, the spouse of Christ, at a time when so many snares undermine true Religion, the sound rule of the sacred canons is so brazenly despised, agitated and furious men, as if by an irrepressible eagerness for novelty, do not hesitate to attack the very foundations of rational nature and even attempt - if they could - to subvert them? Certainly, in the midst of so many reasons for trepidation, there would remain in us no hope of serving usefully, if he who protects Israel and says to his disciples: \"Behold, I am with you always, even unto the consummation of the ages; if he did not deign not only to be the keeper of the sheep, but also the shepherd of the shepherds themselves\" (St Leo M., Sermon V, chapter 2). 3. Since the divine gifts descend most abundantly upon us, especially when Our prayer rises up to God, We turn to you, Venerable Brothers, Our co-workers and counsellors, asking you first of all - in the name of that charity by which we are one in the Lord, and of that faith by which we are united in one body, that you do not cease to pray daily to God, that he may comfort us with the power of his virtue, that he may pour out upon us the spirit of wisdom and strength, so that in the midst of so many difficulties of things and times we may see what we have to do and be able to accomplish it after we have seen it. Therefore pray in spirit; and let your prayer be an invocation of love for Us and an irrefutable proof of brotherly union. And so that we may more readily obtain what is necessary for us, let Mary, the Most Holy Mother of God, in whose protection we have the greatest confidence, and all the Celestial Curia intercede; And especially implore for us the protection and help of the Most Blessed Apostle Peter \"whose seat we enjoy not so much to occupy as to serve, hoping that through his prayers the God of mercy will graciously contemplate the times in which we must exercise Our Ministry, and will always deign to protect and restore the shepherd of His sheep\" (St. Leo M., p. 5). , Sermo V, ch. 5). 4. In truth, at the very beginning of Our apostolic service, which We have undertaken with all the commitment of paternal charity of which We are capable, We urge You, Venerable Brothers, and exhort You to be faithful stewards of the mysteries of God. You, who are partakers of the Lord, are not ignorant of what you must do, what labours you must sustain for the Church of God in order to fulfil your duty constantly. We therefore urge you and ask you to keep alive the grace that has been given to you by the imposition of the Lord.","pope":"Pius VI","type":"Encyclical","year":1775}

As we reflect on the burden of the supreme Apostolate imposed upon us, and consider its gravity and immense weight, we cannot refrain, Venerable Brothers, from feeling a deep emotion in view of so sublime a mission and of Our personal weakness. It seems to us that we have come to the middle of the sea and that we have been withdrawn from the security of a peaceful life, as from a safe harbour, to see ourselves so suddenly called to steer the ship of Peter, battered by the waves and almost submerged by the storm. But this is the Lord's work, and it is admirable in Our eyes. The inscrutable judgments of God, and not human wills, have entrusted us with the most serious functions of the Apostolate when we were far from thinking of them. This persuasion gives Us full confidence that He Who has called Us to the heavy cares of the supreme ministry will dispel Our fears, help Our weakness, and succour Us in the storm. Peter, who is to be Our model, was reassured by the Lord who rebuked him for his lack of faith when he thought he would be submerged in the sea. He who in the person of the Prince of the Apostles entrusted to Us the care of the universal Church and the keys of the kingdom of heaven, He who commanded Us to feed His sheep and to confirm our brethren, surely wants Our spirit to conceive no fear of not obtaining His help. He willed that We should be moved more by the hope of His grace than by apprehension of Our weakness. We therefore submit ourselves to the will of Him Who is Our strength and support, and trust in His faithfulness and power: He will accomplish the work which He has begun in Us. From Our nothingness, the greatness of His strength and goodness will receive a greater splendour. If He has thought, in these times, to make use of Our ministry and to use Us, who are a useless servant, to do something for the good of His Church, each one will acknowledge that He alone is the author of it, and that to Him alone must be given the honour and the glory. We therefore prepare ourselves without further delay to bear this great burden, willing to put all the more zeal into it as we are supported by a strong foundation, convinced that the high importance of the functions to which we have been called demands such care and prudence that they can never be too great. When we are continually concerned with the vastness of Our administration, and cast a glance from the heights of the Apostolic See over the whole Christian universe, we see you, Venerable Brethren, elevated to eminent and illustrious posts, and the sight of you fills Us with joy. It is with the greatest satisfaction that we recognise in you Our co-workers, the guardians of the Lord's flock, the labourers in the Gospel vineyard. To you, therefore, who share Our care, We wish first of all to address Our word at the beginning of Our Apostolate. We wish to impart to your hearts the innermost feelings of Our soul; and if in the name of the Lord We address to you some exhortations, attribute them to the distrust we have of Ourselves, and think also that they proceed from the confidence inspired in Us by your virtue and your filial love for Us. 2. In the first place, Venerable Brothers, we ask and entreat you never to tire of praying to God to sustain Our weakness with His divine help. In this way, repay the love we have for you. Add to Our prayers the comfort of yours, so that by supporting one another we may be more constant and vigilant. We shall show by the union of hearts that unity by which we all form one body, for the whole Church is but one building, of which the Prince of the Apostles laid the foundation in this See. Many united stones contribute to this construction; but all of them are supported and sustained by one. The body of the Church is one; Jesus Christ is its head, and it is in him that we all become one. He has willed that we, the vicar of his power, should be elevated above the others, and that you, united with us as the visible head of the Church, should be the principal parts of his body. What, then, can happen to one that does not also touch the others, and that does not affect each of them? In the same way, therefore, there can be nothing which claims Your vigilance and which is not at the same time a matter of Our care and which must not be reported to Us. In the same way, also, You must think that everything that concerns Us and everything that requires Our attention and Our help must interest You in the highest degree. We must therefore all, keeping our wills closely united, be animated by this one and the same thing.","pope":"Clement XIV","type":"Encyclical","year":1769}
{"_id":{"$oid":"610da1df0a910b526c92c870"},"text":"Pope Clement XIII. Venerable Brothers, Health and Apostolic Blessing. 1. From the day on which, beyond all our foresight, the incredible event occurred that Our humility was elevated by divine intervention to the Sacred See of Blessed Peter, the summit of all the Churches, we would have abandoned ourselves to sadness and tears, had it not been for the fact that something similar happened to the Most Holy Prophet and zealous leader of the people of Israel. For, crying out to the Lord, Moses said: \"Why have you treated your servant so badly? And why have you laid upon him the burden of all this people? I cannot carry the burden of all this people by myself; it is too heavy a burden for me\". (Numbers 11:11,14). In order that he might not lose heart and be able to carry well the burden he had accepted, God commanded him to summon seventy men, chosen from among the elders, in whom he infused the spirit of Moses, that they might be teachers of the people and share the burden with him, and that Moses might not have to carry it alone. At this time, Venerable Brethren, our only consolation comes to Us from the fact that God long ago chose you from the multitude of the Faithful to entrust you with the care of souls: He assigned you to Us as Our help, and filled you with His own spirit, when you were initiated into the Episcopal Mysteries, to such an extent that, trusting first of all in God's help and in His strength, and then in the singular zeal with which you burn in the fulfilment of your ministry, and counting on your wisdom, we believe that our sadness and concern can be largely overcome. We have therefore written this letter to you both \"to strengthen myself with you and among you by the faith which you and I have in common\" (Rom 1:12). We have therefore written this letter to you both \"to strengthen myself with you and with one another through the faith which you and I have in common\" (Rom 1:12), and \"to awaken with admonitions your sound understanding\" (2 Pet 3:1), but above all to urge you to carry out your ministry faithfully, urging you, whom we already know to be zealous, ready for battle and vigilant against the terrible enemy of the human race, to oppose it with greater readiness and courage and, \"having climbed the breach\", to stand \"as a bulwark in defence of the Israelites\" (Ez 13:5). 2. In this war unleashed on so many fronts and so dangerous, the hope of victory will be all the greater and more certain the more \"we preserve the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace\" (Eph 4:3). Therefore, Venerable Brothers, with all your strength, your Charity should strive to ensure that even the germs of any internal strife are eradicated from the minds of the Faithful. It is your urgent task to ensure that all \"seek peace\" (1 Pet 3:11), that all \"give themselves to the works of peace\" (Rom 14:19). The Lord Jesus himself, shortly before giving himself up to the Passion, \"I leave you peace\", he said to the Apostles, \"I give you my peace\" (Jn 14:27). And not only to the Apostles, but also to us he bequeathed peace: \"I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who through their word will believe in me, that they may all be one. As you, Father, in me and I in you, may they also be one in us\" (Jn 17:20-21). I beseech you, Venerable Brothers, let us always strive to preserve with constancy this inheritance, so great and so magnificent, entrusted to us by Christ the Lord, in order to extinguish dissension in the souls of the faithful. The pledge of this inheritance, says the Apostle, is the Holy Spirit. Therefore, when we stand before God and ask him to send the Holy Spirit from heaven to sanctify the sacrifice of the Church, it is clear that this is what we are really asking: that through his spiritual grace the unity of charity be preserved intact in the Church. But we must all bear this in mind: when the Lord asked the people who the Son of Man was and who they believed him to be, while some reported one opinion and others another, Blessed Peter, interpreting the thoughts of all, by a revelation coming not from flesh nor blood but from the Father, declared that he was the Son of the living God (Mt 16:14ff). 3. From this it is clear that even then there was this difference between the children of the light and the children of the world: the latter had different opinions and were therefore divided among themselves; those, on the other hand, initiated into the Mystery of Unity, by the mouth of their Head and thus by the mouth of one, professed the one faith common to all. Therefore, Venerable Brothers, use all your strength to consolidate peace among the faithful. Let unrest, \"strife, envy, animosity, dissensions\" (2 Cor 12:20) disappear completely, so that those who bear the Catholic name \"may be in perfect union of thought and purpose\", \"all of them unanimous in speech\" (1 Cor 1:10), \"having the same sentiments\" (2 Cor 13:11), and may understand well and fix in their minds that those who wish to be Catholics \"have the same faith\" (2 Cor 13:11).","pope":"Clement XIII","type":"Encyclical","year":1758}

Although it has long been known to Our paternal vigilance - for which we must be solicitous to render full and judicious justice to each one - that for the convenience of the disputants, in order to settle and define them as is fitting, cases are entrusted outside Our Roman Curia to some (according to what is said) who lack both an adequate knowledge of the laws, However, we have been struck by a more acute displeasure because this abuse, which has become public knowledge, is openly confirmed by the many complaints forwarded to the Apostolic See and by the ever more numerous letters sent to Us. The main reasons for this abuse, which are evident from many of these letters, concern above all the high number of Protonotaries who lack competence. They are delegated the aforementioned cases, since they have been appointed to ecclesiastical dignity, for the time they remain in this office, without being subjected to a prior careful examination of their merits and qualities, and without carefully considering whether they possess the requisites of juridical competence and the pulse to hold the reins of justice. 1. Sincere concern and deep sorrow have crept into our souls when we have learned that the property and activities of others are endangered and made uncertain by the ignorance and wickedness of judges: this can be fully understood by those who know thoroughly the deep zeal that animates Us in the administration of justice. But since Our paternal charity, having been entrusted to Us with the salvation of the peoples, cannot remain silent any longer, We are induced to put in hand the opportune remedies to eliminate corruption and restore integrity to the judgments. We know that these complaints are not recent, but of long standing; therefore, it is not a question of a disease that is now taking its first steps, but of an established evil. There is no need, therefore, to devise new remedies to eliminate it, but to make operative those that have long been established. The origin of this evil cannot be blamed on our Roman Curia, but on those who unjustly complain about the Curia's practices. 2. If one turns one's attention back in time, one can easily discover how such complaints were presented to Pope Boniface VIII of happy memory and the same Pontiff, in order to fulfil his office of apostolic address, by his decree (Statuto dei rescritti, cap. 6) rightly established that the Apostolic See and its Legates should not delegate cases except to ecclesiastical dignitaries who had obtained an office or canonry in a cathedral church, and that trials should not be held in an unknown but prestigious city with a large population, where a good number of competent judges were available. It is reasonable to believe that the Council of Trent had also been presented with a petition on the question of the inexperience of judges. In fact, after having stated that the Apostolic See did not delegate cases to suitable judges everywhere and that this happened sometimes because of the evil interference of the powerful, sometimes because of the remoteness of the places from which it was not possible to have information about the people to whom the cases were delegated, \"the same Council established that in all the provincial or diocesan Synods some people with the qualities provided for by the Constitution of Boniface VIII should be designated, suitable to carry out this office, to whom the cases should be delegated in the future. If in the meantime any of the persons chosen died, the local Ordinary, having heard the opinion of the chapter, was to designate a substitute until the future provincial or diocesan Synod. In this way, each diocese had at its disposal four or more competent and qualified persons to whom the causes could be entrusted. Once the designation had been made, which was to be transmitted immediately to the Roman Pontiff, any delegation to judges other than those designated would have been conferred surreptitiously\" (Conc. Trid., sess. 25, ch. 10, De reform.). 3. But since the convocation of the provincial and diocesan Synods, which should have been convened every three years and every year respectively, as prescribed by the Council of Trent, had been procrastinated due to adverse circumstances, the bishops, not having the well-founded hope that, once the obstacles had been removed, they would be able to convene these Synods in order to designate synodal judges in place of those who had died, often asked questions about this to the Congregation of the Council of Trent. The Congregation replied that the designation of the judges to be replaced was to be made by the bishops after consultation with the chapter. 4. These providential and ancient provisions clearly show that the wounds inflicted on this specific institution have not been removed.","pope":"Benedict XIV","type":"Encyclical","year":1741}
