In the last decades the emancipation achieved by women has been having repercussions in the
religious field arising debates about the women's role in the Church.
The aim of this project is to employ and develop machine learning solutions to analyze the
evolution of the gender roles in the history of the Catholic Church. In particular, the word
embedding-based techniques used to detect and study gender bias and stereotypes in text will be
exploited in the project in order to analyze how an old institution such as the Church is changing
its position regarding the women's role.
In this regard, the project intends to study the word of the popes in the Vatican publications from
Urban IV to Francis (1261-2020).
